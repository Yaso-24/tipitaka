<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.1 : What’s the Purpose? </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, what is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, having no regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of having no regrets?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Joy is the purpose and benefit of having no regrets.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of joy?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Rapture …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of rapture?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Tranquility …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of tranquility?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Bliss …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of bliss?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Immersion …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of immersion?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Truly knowing and seeing …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Disillusionment and dispassion …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, Ānanda, the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics is not having regrets. Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets. Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy. Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture. Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility. Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss. Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion. Disillusionment and dispassion is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion. So, Ānanda, skillful ethics progressively lead up to the highest.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.2 : Making a Wish </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, an ethical person, who has fulfilled ethical conduct, need not make a wish: ‘May I have no regrets!’ It’s only natural that an ethical person has no regrets. When you have no regrets you need not make a wish: ‘May I feel joy!’ It’s only natural that joy springs up when you have no regrets. When you feel joy you need not make a wish: ‘May I experience rapture!’ It’s only natural that rapture arises when you’re joyful. When your mind is full of rapture you need not make a wish: ‘May my body become tranquil!’ It’s only natural that your body becomes tranquil when your mind is full of rapture. When your body is tranquil you need not make a wish: ‘May I feel bliss!’ It’s only natural to feel bliss when your body is tranquil. When you feel bliss you need not make a wish: ‘May my mind be immersed in samādhi!’ It’s only natural for the mind to be immersed in samādhi when you feel bliss. When your mind is immersed in samādhi you need not make a wish: ‘May I truly know and see!’ It’s only natural to truly know and see when your mind is immersed in samādhi. When you truly know and see you need not make a wish: ‘May I become disillusioned and dispassionate!’ It’s only natural to become disillusioned and dispassionate when you truly know and see. When you’re disillusioned and dispassionate you need not make a wish: ‘May I realize the knowledge and vision of freedom!’ It’s only natural to realize the knowledge and vision of freedom when you’re disillusioned and dispassionate.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so, mendicants, the knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion. Disillusionment and dispassion is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion. Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss. Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility. Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture. Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy. Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets. Not having regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics. And so, mendicants, good qualities flow on and fill up from one to the other, for going from the near shore to the far shore.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.6 : Immersion </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Could it be, sir, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. And they wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And yet they would still perceive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It could be, Ānanda, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. And they wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And yet they would still perceive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But how could this be, sir?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant perceives: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. And they wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And yet they would still perceive.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.7 : Sāriputta </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Could it be, reverend Sāriputta, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. And they wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And yet they would still perceive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It could be, Reverend Ānanda.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But how could this be?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Ānanda, one time I was staying right here at Sāvatthī in the Dark Forest. There I gained a state of immersion like this. I didn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And I didn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. And I didn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And yet I still perceived.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But at that time what did Reverend Sāriputta perceive?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“One perception arose in me and another perception ceased: ‘The cessation of continued existence is extinguishment. The cessation of continued existence is extinguishment.’ Suppose there was a burning pile of twigs. One flame would arise and another would cease. In the same way, one perception arose in me and another perception ceased: ‘The cessation of continued existence is extinguishment. The cessation of continued existence is extinguishment.’ At that time I perceived that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.8 : Inspiring All Around: the Absorptions </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical. So they’re incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking: ‘How can I become faithful and ethical?’ When the mendicant is faithful and ethical, they’re complete in that respect.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant is faithful and ethical, but not educated. … they’re not a Dhamma speaker … they don’t frequent assemblies … they don’t teach Dhamma to the assembly with assurance … they’re not an expert in the training … they don’t stay in the wilderness, in remote lodgings … they don’t get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty … they don’t realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. So they’re incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking: ‘How can I become faithful, ethical, and educated, a Dhamma speaker, one who frequents assemblies, one who teaches Dhamma to the assembly with assurance, an expert in the training, one who lives in the wilderness, in remote lodgings, one who gets the four absorptions when they want, and one who lives having realized the ending of defilements?’</p>

So they’re incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking: ‘How can I become faithful, ethical, and educated, a Dhamma speaker, one who frequents assemblies, one who teaches Dhamma to the assembly with assurance, an expert in the training, one who lives in the wilderness, in remote lodgings, one who gets the formless liberations, and one who lives having realized the ending of defilements?’</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.11 : Lodgings </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant with five factors, using and frequenting lodgings with five factors, will soon realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant have five factors? It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation. They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions. They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. That’s how a mendicant has five factors.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a lodging have five factors? It’s when a lodging is neither too far nor too near, but convenient for coming and going. It’s not bothered by people by day, and at night it’s quiet and still. There’s little disturbance from flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. While staying in that lodging the necessities of life—robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are easy to come by. And in that lodging there are several senior mendicants who are very learned, knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the texts on monastic training, and the outlines. From time to time they go up to those mendicants and ask them questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. That’s how a lodging has five factors. A mendicant with five factors, using and frequenting lodgings with five factors, will soon realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, is said to be the best of all sentient beings—be they footless, with two feet, four feet, or many feet; with form or formless; with perception or without perception or with neither perception nor non-perception. In the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in diligence and meet at diligence, and diligence is said to be the best of them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint, so an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. In the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in diligence and meet at diligence, and diligence is said to be the best of them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The rafters of a bungalow all lean to the peak, slope to the peak, and meet at the peak, so the peak is said to be the topmost of them all. In the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in diligence and meet at diligence, and diligence is said to be the best of them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Of all kinds of fragrant root, spikenard is said to be the best. In the same way …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Of all kinds of fragrant heartwood, red sandalwood is said to be the best. In the same way …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Of all kinds of fragrant flower, jasmine is said to be the best. In the same way …</p>
<p class="bodytext">All lesser kings are vassals of a wheel-turning monarch, so the wheel-turning monarch is said to be the foremost of them all. In the same way …</p>
<p class="bodytext">The radiance of all the stars is not worth a sixteenth part of the moon’s radiance, so the moon’s radiance is said to be the best of them all. In the same way …</p>
<p class="bodytext">After the rainy season the sky is clear and cloudless. And when the sun rises, it dispels all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates. In the same way …</p>
<p class="bodytext">All the great rivers—that is, the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—flow, slant, slope, and incline towards the ocean, and the ocean is said to be the greatest of them. In the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in diligence and meet at diligence, and diligence is said to be the best of them.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, these ten people are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the world.

Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is a quality that serves as protector.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.18 : A Protector (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.19 : Abodes of the Noble Ones (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“There are these ten noble abodes in which the noble ones of the past, present, and future abide. What ten? A mendicant has given up five factors, is endowed with six factors, has a single guard, has four supports, has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has pure intentions, has stilled the physical process, and is well freed in mind and well freed by wisdom. These are the ten noble abodes in which the noble ones of the past, present, and future abide.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.20 : Abodes of the Noble Ones (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There are these ten noble abodes in which the noble ones of the past, present, and future abide. What ten? A mendicant has given up five factors, possesses six factors, has a single guard, has four supports, has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has unsullied intentions, has stilled the physical process, and is well freed in mind and well freed by wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how has a mendicant given up five factors? It’s when a mendicant has given up sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. That’s how a mendicant has given up five factors.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant possess six factors? It’s when a mendicant, seeing a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Hearing a sound with their ears … Smelling an odor with their nose … Tasting a flavor with their tongue …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Feeling a touch with their body … Knowing a thought with their mind, they’re neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. That’s how a mendicant possesses six factors.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant have a single guard? It’s when a mendicant’s heart is guarded by mindfulness. That’s how a mendicant has a single guard.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant have four supports? After reflection, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things. That’s how a mendicant has four supports.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth? Different ascetics and brahmins have different idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. For example: the world is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. A mendicant has dispelled, eliminated, thrown out, rejected, let go of, given up, and relinquished all these. That’s how a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how has a mendicant totally given up searching? It’s when they’ve given up searching for sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and for a spiritual life. That’s how a mendicant has totally given up searching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant have unsullied intentions? It’s when a mendicant has given up intentions of sensuality, malice, and cruelty. That’s how a mendicant has unsullied intentions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how has a mendicant stilled the physical process? It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That’s how a mendicant has stilled the physical process.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is a mendicant well freed in mind? It’s when a mendicant’s mind is freed from greed, hate, and delusion. That’s how a mendicant is well freed in mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is a mendicant well freed by wisdom? It’s when a mendicant understands: ‘I’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they’re unable to arise in the future.’ That’s how a mendicant’s mind is well freed by wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mendicants, whether in the past, future, or present, all the noble ones of noble abodes abide in these same ten noble abodes. These are the ten noble abodes in which the noble ones of the past, present, and future abide.”</p></div>

<p class="title">3. The Great Chapter</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.21 : The Lion’s Roar </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, towards evening the lion, king of beasts, emerges from his den, yawns, looks all around the four directions, and roars his lion’s roar three times. Then he sets out on the hunt. Why is that? Thinking: ‘May I not accidentally injure any little creatures that happen to be in the wrong place.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Lion’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. When the Realized One teaches Dhamma to an assembly, this is his lion’s roar.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Realized One possesses ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel. What ten? Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands where all paths of practice lead. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the world with its many and diverse elements. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the diverse attitudes of sentient beings. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the faculties of other sentient beings and other individuals after comprehending them with his mind. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Thus he recollects his many past lives, with features and details. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the ten powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.22 : Hypotheses </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, I claim to be assured regarding the teachings that lead to realizing by insight the various different hypotheses. So I am able to teach the Dhamma in appropriate ways to different people. Practicing accordingly, when something exists they’ll know it exists. When it doesn’t exist they’ll know it doesn’t exist. When something is inferior they’ll know it’s inferior. When it’s superior they’ll know it’s superior. When something is not supreme they’ll know it’s not supreme. When it is supreme they’ll know it’s supreme. And they will know or see or realize it in whatever way it should be known or seen or realized. This is possible. But this is the unsurpassable knowledge, that is: truly knowing each and every case. And Ānanda, I say that there is no other knowledge better or finer than this.</p>

Please give up that bad bodily conduct and develop good bodily conduct.’ When spoken to by their sensible spiritual companions they give up that bad bodily conduct and develop good bodily conduct.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.26 : With Kāḷī </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the laywoman Kāḷī of Kurughara went up to Venerable Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Maidens’ Questions’:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘I’ve reached the goal, peace of heart. </p>
<p class="gatha">Having conquered the army of the likable and pleasant, </p>
<p class="gatha">alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss. </p>

<p class="bodytext">How should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sister, some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal earth to be the ultimate. Thinking ‘this is the goal’, they are reborn. The Buddha directly knew the extent to which the attainment of the meditation on universal earth was the ultimate. Directly knowing this he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape. And he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths. Because he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths, he knew that he had reached the goal, peace of heart.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.27 : The Great Questions (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: ‘Please, mendicants, directly know all things. Meditate having directly known all things.’ We too teach our disciples: ‘Please, reverends, directly know all things. Live having directly known all things.’ What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths. They got up from their seat, thinking, “We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, after the meal, when they returned from alms-round, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them: ‘One thing: question, passage for recitation, and answer. Two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight … nine … ten things: question, passage for recitation, and answer.’ Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. Why is that? Because they’re out of their element. I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘One thing: question, passage for recitation, and answer.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? Becoming completely disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding one thing, seeing its limits and fully comprehending its meaning, a mendicant makes an end of suffering in this very life.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.30 : Kosala (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala returned from combat after winning a battle and succeeding in his objective. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went to the monastery. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At that time several mendicants were walking meditation in the open air. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to them and said, “Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha? For I want to see the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Great king, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock with the latch. The Buddha will open the door.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the king approached the Buddha’s dwelling and knocked, and the Buddha opened the door. Then King Pasenadi entered the Buddha’s dwelling. He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name: “Sir, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala! I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But great king, for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body, conveying your manifest love?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, it’s because of my gratitude and thanks for the Buddha that I demonstrate such utmost devotion, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha is practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people. He has established many people in the noble method, that is, the principles of goodness and skillfulness. This is a reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Buddha is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is mature, noble, and skillful. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Buddha lives in the wilderness, frequenting remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Buddha is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Buddha gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Buddha gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Buddha recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Buddha has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Please, great king, go at your convenience.” Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.</p></div>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.31 : With Upāli </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Upāli went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, for how many reasons did the Realized One lay down training rules for his disciples and recite the monastic code?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Upāli, the Realized One laid down training rules for his disciples and recited the monastic code for ten reasons. What ten? For the well-being of the Saṅgha and for the comfort of the Saṅgha. For keeping difficult persons in check and for the comfort of good-hearted mendicants. For restraining defilements that affect the present life and protecting against defilements that affect lives to come. For inspiring confidence in those without it, and increasing confidence in those who have it. For the continuation of the true teaching and the support of the training. The Realized One laid down training rules for his disciples and recited the monastic code for these ten reasons.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.32 : Suspending the Recitation of the Monastic Code </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, how many grounds are there to suspend the recitation of the monastic code?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Upāli, there are ten grounds to suspend the recitation of the monastic code. What ten? A mendicant who has committed an expulsion offense is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone has committed an expulsion offense is unfinished. A person who is not fully ordained is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone is fully ordained or not is unfinished. Someone who has rejected the training is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone has rejected the training or not is unfinished. A eunuch is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether someone is a eunuch is unfinished. A raper of nuns is sitting in the assembly. A discussion about whether or not someone is a raper of nuns is unfinished. These are the ten grounds to suspend the recitation of the monastic code.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.33 : A Judge </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, how many qualities should a mendicant have to be agreed on as a judge?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Upāli, a mendicant should have ten qualities to be agreed on as a judge. What ten? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. Both monastic codes have been passed down to them in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well judged in both the rules and accompanying material. They’re firm and unfaltering in the training. When there are opposing parties, they’re able to persuade, advocate, and convince them, make them see the other side and trust each other. They’re skilled in raising and settling disciplinary issues. They know what a disciplinary issue is. They know how a disciplinary issue originates. They know how a disciplinary issue ceases. They know the practical way leading to the cessation of a disciplinary issue. A mendicant should have these ten qualities to be agreed on as a judge.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.34 : Ordination </h3>

They’re able to care for the sick or get someone else to do so. They’re able to settle dissatisfaction or get someone else to do so. They’re able to dispel remorse when it has come up. They’re able to rationally dissuade someone from misconceptions that come up. They’re able to encourage someone in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, how many qualities should a mendicant have to give dependence?”</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.37 : Schism in the Saṅgha </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, they speak of ‘schism in the Saṅgha’. How is schism in the Saṅgha defined?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Upāli, it’s when a mendicant explains what is not the teaching as the teaching, and what is the teaching as not the teaching. They explain what is not the training as the training, and what is the training as not the training. They explain what was not spoken and stated by the Realized One as spoken and stated by the Realized One, and what was spoken and stated by the Realized One as not spoken and stated by the Realized One. They explain what was not practiced by the Realized One as practiced by the Realized One, and what was practiced by the Realized One as not practiced by the Realized One. They explain what was not prescribed by the Realized One as prescribed by the Realized One, and what was prescribed by the Realized One as not prescribed by the Realized One. On these ten grounds they split off and go their own way. They perform legal acts autonomously and recite the monastic code autonomously. That is how schism in the Saṅgha is defined.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.38 : Harmony in the Saṅgha </h3>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.39 : With Ānanda (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>

<p class="bodytext">“But sir, what does someone who has caused a schism in a harmonious Saṅgha bring upon themselves?”</p>

<p class="gatha0">A schismatic remains for the eon </p>
<p class="gatha">in a place of loss, in hell. </p>
<p class="gatha">Basing themselves in what is not the teaching, </p>

<p class="gatha">After causing schism in a harmonious Saṅgha, </p>
<p class="gatha">they burn in hell for an eon.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.41 : Arguments </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Upāli went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason, why arguments, quarrels, and disputes arise in the Saṅgha, and the mendicants don’t live happily?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Upāli, it’s when a mendicant explains what is not the teaching as the teaching, and what is the teaching as not the teaching.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.42 : Roots of Arguments (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, how many roots of arguments are there?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Upāli, there are ten roots of arguments. What ten? It’s when a mendicant explains what is not the teaching as the teaching, and what is the teaching as not the teaching.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.44 : At Kusināra </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Kusināra, in the Forest of Offerings. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant who wants to accuse another should first check five things in themselves and establish five things in themselves. What five things should they check in themselves? A mendicant who wants to accuse another should check this: ‘Is my bodily behavior pure? Do I have pure bodily behavior that is impeccable and irreproachable? Is this thing found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be people who say: ‘Come on, venerable, train your own bodily behavior first.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant who wants to accuse another should check this: ‘Is my verbal behavior pure? Do I have pure verbal behavior that is impeccable and irreproachable? Is this thing found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be people who say: ‘Come on, venerable, train your own verbal behavior first.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant who wants to accuse another should check this: ‘Is my heart established in love for my spiritual companions, without resentment? Is this thing found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be people who say: ‘Come on, venerable, establish your heart in love for your spiritual companions first.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant who wants to accuse another should check this: ‘Am I very learned, remembering and keeping what I’ve learned? These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. Am I very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically? Is this thing found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be people who say: ‘Come on, venerable, memorize the scriptures first.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant who wants to accuse another should check this: ‘Have both monastic codes been passed down to me in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, and well judged in both the rules and accompanying material? Is this thing found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be people who say: ‘Come on, venerable, train in the code of conduct first.’ These are the five things they should check in themselves.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What five things should they establish in themselves? ‘I will speak at the right time, not at the wrong time. I will speak truthfully, not falsely. I will speak gently, not harshly. I will speak beneficially, not harmfully. I will speak lovingly, not from secret hate.’ These are the five things they should establish in themselves. A mendicant who wants to accuse another should first check these five things in themselves and establish these five things in themselves.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.45 : Entering a Royal Harem </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are ten drawbacks to entering a royal harem. What ten?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, a king is sitting with his chief queen when a monk enters. When the queen sees the monk she smiles, or when the monk sees the queen he smiles. So the king thinks: ‘They’ve done it for sure, or they will do it.’ This is the first drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a king has many duties, and much to do. He has sex with one of the women but doesn’t remember. She gets pregnant from that. So the king thinks: ‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the second drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a gem is lost somewhere in the royal harem. So the king thinks: ‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the third drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, secret deliberations in the royal harem are leaked outside. So the king thinks: ‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the fourth drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, in a royal harem, a father longs for their son, or a son longs for his father. They think: ‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the fifth drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the king promotes someone to a higher position. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king is close to that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the sixth drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the king demotes someone to a lower position. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king is close to that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the seventh drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the king dispatches the army at the wrong time. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king is close to that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the eighth drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the king dispatches the army at the right time, but orders it to turn back while still on the road. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king is close to that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the ninth drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, in the royal harem there is a trampling of elephants, horses, and chariots, as well as arousing sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches that do not befit a monk. This is the tenth drawback of entering a royal harem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the ten drawbacks of entering a royal harem.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.46 : With the Sakyans </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then on the sabbath several Sakyan lay followers went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sakyans, do you observe the sabbath with its eight factors?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, sometimes we do, sometimes we don’t.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s your loss, Sakyans, it’s your misfortune. In this life with its fear of sorrow and death, you sometimes keep the sabbath and you sometimes don’t.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Sakyans? Take a man who earns half a dollar for an honest day’s work. Is this enough to call him a deft and industrious man?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Sakyans? Take a man who earns a dollar for an honest day’s work. Is this enough to call him a deft and industrious man?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Sakyans? Take a man who, for an honest day’s work, earns two dollars … three dollars … four dollars … five dollars … six dollars … seven dollars … eight dollars … nine dollars … ten dollars … twenty dollars … thirty dollars … forty dollars … fifty dollars … a hundred dollars. Is this enough to call him a deft and industrious man?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Sakyans? Suppose that man earned a hundred or a thousand dollars every day and saved it all up. If he lived for a hundred years, would he not accumulate a large mass of wealth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Sakyans? Would that man, on account of that wealth, experience perfect happiness for a single day or night, or even half a day or night?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Why is that?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Because sensual pleasures, sir, are impermanent, hollow, false, and deceptive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But take one of my disciples who lives diligent, keen, and resolute for ten years, practicing in line with my instructions. They can experience perfect happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, or a hundred thousand years. And they could become a once-returner or a non-returner, or guaranteed a stream-enterer. Let alone ten years, take one of my disciples who lives diligent, keen, and resolute for nine years … eight years … seven years … six years … five years … four years … three years … two years … one year … ten months … nine months … eight months … seven months … six months … five months … four months … three months … two months … one month … a fortnight … ten days … nine days … eight days … seven days … six days … five days … four days … three days … two days …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Let alone two days, take one of my disciples who lives diligent, keen, and resolute for one day, practicing in line with my instructions. They can experience perfect happiness for a hundred years, ten thousand years, or a hundred thousand years. And they could become a once-returner or a non-returner, or guaranteed a stream-enterer. It’s your loss, Sakyans, it’s your misfortune. In this life with its fear of sorrow and death, you sometimes keep the sabbath and you sometimes don’t.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, sir, from this day forth we will observe the sabbath with its eight factors.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.47 : With Mahāli </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Mahāli the Licchavi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason for doing bad deeds, for performing bad deeds?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Greed is a cause, Mahāli, greed is a reason for doing bad deeds, for performing bad deeds. Hate is a cause of bad deeds … Delusion is a cause of bad deeds … Improper attention is a cause of bad deeds … A wrongly directed mind is a cause of bad deeds … This is the cause, Mahāli, this is the reason for doing bad deeds, for performing bad deeds.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason for doing good deeds, for performing good deeds?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Contentment is a cause, Mahāli, contentment is a reason for doing good deeds, for performing good deeds. Love is a cause of good deeds … Understanding is a cause of good deeds … Proper attention is a cause of good deeds … A rightly directed mind is a cause of good deeds … This is the cause, Mahāli, this is the reason for doing good deeds, for performing good deeds. If these ten things were not found in the world, we wouldn’t see either unprincipled and immoral conduct, or principled and moral conduct. But since these ten things are found in the world, we see both unprincipled and immoral conduct, and principled and moral conduct.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.48 : Ten Regular Reflections for a Renunciate </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, one who has gone forth should often review these ten things. What ten?</p>
<p class="bodytext">One who has gone forth should often review this: ‘I have secured freedom from class.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘My livelihood is tied up with others.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘My behavior should be different.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘I hope there’s no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘I hope that, after examination, sensible spiritual companions don’t reproach any aspect of my ethics?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘I must be parted and separated from all I hold dear and beloved.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘I am the owner of my deeds and heir to my deeds. Deeds are my womb, my relative, and my refuge.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I shall be the heir of whatever deeds I do, whether good or bad.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘As the days and nights flit by, what sort of person am I becoming?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Do I love to stay in empty huts?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Do I have any superhuman distinctions in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, so that when my spiritual companions question me on my deathbed I will not be embarrassed?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">One who has gone forth should often review these ten things.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.49 : Existing Because of the Body </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, these ten things exist because of the body. What ten? Cold, heat, hunger, thirst, feces, urine, restraint of body, speech, and livelihood, and the will to live that leads to future lives. These ten things exist because of the body.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.50 : Arguments </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time, after the meal, on return from alms-round, several mendicants sat together in the meeting hall. They were arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding each other with barbed words.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, after the meal, on return from alms-round, we sat together in the meeting hall, arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding each other with barbed words.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, this is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are ten warm-hearted qualities that make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling. What ten? Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. When a mendicant is ethical, this warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re patient, and take instruction respectfully. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is deft and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, understanding how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant loves the teachings and is a delight to converse with, being full of joy in the teaching and training. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. When a mendicant is wise, this warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, helping the Saṅgha to live in harmony and unity, without quarreling.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These ten warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.”</p></div>

<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, if you were to recite to the mendicant Girimānanda these ten perceptions, it’s possible that after hearing them his illness will die down on the spot.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What ten? The perceptions of impermanence, not-self, ugliness, drawbacks, giving up, fading away, cessation, dissatisfaction with the whole world, non-desire for all conditions, and mindfulness of breathing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the perception of impermanence? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.’ And so they meditate observing impermanence in the five grasping aggregates. This is called the perception of impermanence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the perception of not-self? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘The eye and sights, ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes, body and touches, and mind and thoughts are not-self.’ And so they meditate observing not-self in the six interior and exterior sense fields. This is called the perception of not-self.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the perception of ugliness? It’s when a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ And so they meditate observing ugliness in this body. This is called the perception of ugliness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the perception of drawbacks? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘This body has much suffering and many drawbacks. For this body is beset with many kinds of affliction, such as the following. Diseases of the eye, inner ear, nose, tongue, body, head, outer ear, mouth, teeth, and lips. Cough, asthma, catarrh, inflammation, fever, stomach ache, fainting, dysentery, gastric pain, cholera, leprosy, boils, eczema, tuberculosis, epilepsy, herpes, itch, scabs, smallpox, scabies, hemorrhage, diabetes, piles, pimples, and ulcers. Afflictions stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction. Afflictions caused by change in weather, by not taking care of yourself, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds. Cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination.’ And so they meditate observing drawbacks in this body. This is called the perception of drawbacks.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the perception of giving up? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, and they don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. This is called the perception of giving up.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the perception of fading away? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, extinguishment.’ This is called the perception of fading away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the perception of cessation? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, cessation, extinguishment.’ This is called the perception of cessation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world? It’s when a mendicant lives giving up and not grasping on to the attraction and grasping to the world, the mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendencies. This is called the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the perception of non-desire for all conditions? It’s when a mendicant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted with all conditions. This is called the perception of non-desire for all conditions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is mindfulness of breathing? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing in experiencing rapture. They practice breathing out experiencing rapture. They practice breathing in experiencing bliss. They practice breathing out experiencing bliss. They practice breathing in experiencing these emotions. They practice breathing out experiencing these emotions. They practice breathing in stilling these emotions. They practice breathing out stilling these emotions. They practice breathing in experiencing the mind. They practice breathing out experiencing the mind. They practice breathing in gladdening the mind. They practice breathing out gladdening the mind. They practice breathing in immersing the mind. They practice breathing out immersing the mind.

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof, together with several well-known senior disciples. They included Venerables Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkaṭa, Kaṭimbha, Kaṭa, Kaṭissaṅga, and other well-known senior disciples.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time several well-known Licchavis plunged deep into the Great Wood to see the Buddha. Driving a succession of fine carriages, they made a dreadful racket. Then those venerables thought:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“These several well-known Licchavis have plunged deep into the Great Wood to see the Buddha. Driving a succession of fine carriages, they’re making a dreadful racket. But the Buddha has said that sound is a thorn to absorption. Let’s go to the Gosiṅga Sal Wood. There we can meditate comfortably, free of noise and crowds.” Then those venerables went to the Gosiṅga Sal Wood, where they meditated comfortably, free of noise and crowds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, where are Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkaṭa, Kaṭimbha, Kaṭa, and Kaṭissaṅga? Where have these senior disciples gone?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the mendicants told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, mendicants! It’s just as those great disciples have so rightly explained. I have said that sound is a thorn to absorption.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mendicants, there are these ten thorns. What ten? Relishing company is a thorn for someone who loves seclusion. Focusing on the beautiful feature of things is a thorn for someone pursuing the meditation on ugliness. Seeing shows is a thorn to someone restraining the senses. Lingering in the neighborhood of females is a thorn to celibacy. Sound is a thorn to the first absorption. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are a thorn to the second absorption. Rapture is a thorn to the third absorption. Breathing is a thorn to the fourth absorption. Perception and feeling are a thorn to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. Greed, hate, and delusion are thorns.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the laywoman Migasālā, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then the laywoman Migasālā went up to Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, Ānanda, how on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life? My father Purāṇa was celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex. When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was a once-returner, who was reborn in the company of the Joyful Gods. But my uncle Isidatta was not celibate; he lived content with his wife. When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was also a once-returner, who was reborn in the company of the Joyful Gods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">How on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You’re right, sister, but that’s how the Buddha declared it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Ānanda, after receiving almsfood at Migasālā’s house, rose from his seat and left. Then after the meal, on his return from alms-round, Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, who is this laywoman Migasālā, a foolish incompetent matron, with a matron’s wit? And who is it that knows how to assess individuals?</p>

<p class="bodytext">There the Buddha addressed the mendicants concerning the mendicant Kalandaka:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Firstly, a mendicant raises disciplinary issues and doesn’t praise the settlement of disciplinary issues. This quality doesn’t conduce to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant doesn’t want to train, and doesn’t praise taking up the training. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant has bad desires, and doesn’t praise getting rid of desires. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is irritable, and doesn’t praise getting rid of anger. …</p>

<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is not in retreat, and doesn’t praise retreat. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is inhospitable to their spiritual companions, and doesn’t praise hospitality. This quality doesn’t conduce to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Even though a mendicant such as this might wish: ‘If only my spiritual companions would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!’ Still they don’t honor, respect, esteem, and venerate them. Why is that? Because their sensible spiritual companions see that they haven’t given up those bad unskillful qualities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a wild colt was to wish: ‘If only the humans would put me in a thoroughbred’s place, feed me a thoroughbred’s food, and give me a thoroughbred’s grooming.’ Still the humans wouldn’t put them in a thoroughbred’s place, feed them a thoroughbred’s food, or give them a thoroughbred’s grooming. Why is that? Because sensible humans see that they haven’t given up their tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints. In the same way, even though a mendicant such as this might wish: ‘If only my spiritual companions would honor, respect, esteem, and venerate me!’ Still they don’t honor, respect, esteem, and venerate them.

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, any mendicant who abuses and insults their spiritual companions, speaking ill of the noble ones, will, without a doubt, fall into one or other of these ten disasters. What ten? They don’t achieve the unachieved. What they have achieved falls away. They don’t refine their good qualities. They overestimate their good qualities, or live the spiritual life dissatisfied, or commit a corrupt offense, or contract a severe illness, or go mad and lose their mind. They feel lost when they die. And when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Any mendicant who abuses and insults their spiritual companions, speaking ill of the noble ones, will, without a doubt, fall into one or other of these ten disasters.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.89 : With Kokālika </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha, “Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, “Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. He just laid down on banana leaves like a poisoned fish.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Tudu the independent brahmā went to Kokālika, and standing in the sky he said to him, “Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Who are you, reverend?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I am Tudu the independent brahmā.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Didn’t the Buddha declare you a non-returner? So what are you doing back here? See how far you have strayed!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Tudu addressed Kokālika in verse:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“A person is born </p>
<p class="gatha">with an axe in their mouth. </p>
<p class="gatha">A fool cuts themselves with it </p>
<p class="gatha">when they say bad words.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you praise someone worthy of criticism, </p>
<p class="gatha">or criticize someone worthy of praise, </p>

<p class="bodytext">Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, </p>
<p class="gatha">if all you lose is your money </p>

<p class="gatha">and another five quattuordecillion years, </p>
<p class="gatha">a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, </p>
<p class="gatha">having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away. He was reborn in the pink lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, “Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s long, mendicant. It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell. The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“A person is born </p>
<p class="gatha">with an axe in their mouth. </p>

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, a mendicant who has ended the defilements has ten powers that qualify them to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’ What ten?

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.92 : Dangers </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Anyone who steals … Anyone who commits sexual misconduct … Anyone who lies … Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, awakened, blessed.’ They have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom? It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’ This is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.93 : What Is Your View? </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. Then it occurred to him, “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, as he’s in retreat. And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, as they’re in retreat. Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths. Now at that time, the wanderers who follow other paths had come together, making an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming off in the distance, and stopped each other, saying, “Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. The householder Anāthapiṇḍika, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming into our monastery. He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī. Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those wanderers who follow other paths fell silent. Then Anāthapiṇḍika went up to them, and exchanged greetings with those wanderers. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him, “Tell us, householder, what is the view of the ascetic Gotama?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sirs, I don’t know all his views.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, since it seems you don’t know all the views of the ascetic Gotama, tell us, what are the views of the mendicants?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sirs, I don’t know all the mendicants’ views.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, since it seems you don’t know all the views of the ascetic Gotama or of the mendicants, tell us, householder, what is your view?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sirs, it’s not hard for me to explain what my views are. But please, let the venerables explain their own convictions first. Afterwards it won’t be hard for me to explain my views.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him, “The world is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. That’s my view, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another wanderer said, “The world is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. That’s my view, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another wanderer said, “The world is finite …” … “The world is infinite …” … “The soul and the body are the same thing …” … “The soul and the body are different things …” … “A Realized One exists after death …” … “A Realized One doesn’t exist after death …” … “A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death …” … “A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. That’s my view, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, Anāthapiṇḍika said this, “Sirs, regarding the venerable who said this: ‘The world is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. That’s my view, householder.’ This view of his has either arisen from his own improper attention, or is conditioned by what someone else says. But that view is created, conditioned, chosen, dependently originated. Anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. And what’s impermanent is suffering. What he clings to and holds to is just suffering.</p>

<p class="bodytext">When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. Seeing this, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, householder! That’s how you should legitimately and completely refute those foolish men from time to time.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the householder Anāthapiṇḍika with a Dhamma talk, after which Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, not long after Anāthapiṇḍika had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, even a mendicant who has ordained for a hundred years in this teaching and training would legitimately and completely refute those wanderers who follow other paths just as the householder Anāthapiṇḍika did.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.94 : With Vajjiyamāhita </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. Then it occurred to him, “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, as he’s in retreat. And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, as they’re in retreat. Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths. Now at that time, the wanderers who follow other paths had come together, making an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They saw Vajjiyamāhita coming off in the distance, and stopped each other, saying, “Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. The householder Vajjiyamāhita, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming into our monastery. He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Campā.

<p class="bodytext">Then those wanderers who follow other paths fell silent. Then Vajjiyamāhita went up to them, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is it really true, householder? Does the ascetic Gotama criticize all forms of mortification? Does he categorically condemn and denounce those self-mortifiers who live rough?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sirs, the ascetic Gotama does not criticize all forms of mortification. Nor does he categorically condemn and denounce those self-mortifiers who live rough. The Buddha criticizes where it is due, and praises where it is due. In doing so he is one who speaks after analyzing the question, without making generalizations on this point.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him, “Hold on, householder! That ascetic Gotama who you praise is an exterminator who refrains from making statements.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“On this point, also, I reasonably respond to the venerables. The Buddha has stated ‘This is skillful’ and ‘This is unskillful’. So when it comes to what is skillful and unskillful the Buddha makes a statement. He is not an exterminator who refrains from making statements.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. Seeing this, Vajjiyamāhita got up from his seat. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, householder! That’s how you should legitimately and completely refute those foolish men from time to time. Householder, I don’t say that all mortifications should be undergone. But I don’t say that no mortifications should be undergone. I don’t say that all observances should be undertaken. But I don’t say that no observances should be undertaken. I don’t say that all efforts should be tried. But I don’t say that no efforts should be tried. I don’t say that everything should be given up. But I don’t say that nothing should be given up. I don’t say that you should be liberated with all kinds of freedom.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.95 : With Uttiya </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then the wanderer Uttiya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “Master Gotama, is this right: ‘The world is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This has not been declared by me, Uttiya.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then is this right: ‘The world is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This has not been declared by me, Uttiya.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then is this right: ‘The world is finite …’ … ‘The world is infinite …’ … ‘The soul and the body are the same thing …’ … ‘The soul and the body are different things …’ … ‘A Realized One exists after death …’ … ‘A Realized One doesn’t exist after death …’ … ‘A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death …’ … ‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This has not been declared by me, Uttiya.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When asked about all these points, Master Gotama says that they have not been declared by him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So what exactly has been declared by Master Gotama?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Uttiya, I teach my disciples from my own insight in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But when Master Gotama teaches in this way, is the whole world saved, or half, or a third?” But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “The wanderer Uttiya must not get the harmful misconception: ‘When the ascetic Gotama was asked this all-important question he falters without answering. He just can’t do it!’ That would be for his lasting harm and suffering.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Ānanda said to the wanderer Uttiya, “Well then, Reverend Uttiya, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and clever. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out. He doesn’t know how many creatures enter or leave the citadel. But he does know that whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, it’s not the Realized One’s concern whether the whole world is saved by this, or half, or a third. But the Realized One knows that whoever is saved from the world—whether in the past, the future, or the present—all have given up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. They have firmly established their mind in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. And they have truly developed the seven awakening factors. That’s how they’re saved from the world, in the past, future, or present. Uttiya, you were just asking the Buddha the same question as before in a different way. That’s why he didn’t answer.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.96 : With Kokanada </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery. Then Ānanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe.

<p class="bodytext">He saw Ānanda coming off in the distance and said to him, “Who’s here, reverend?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">They wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. They understand mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … mind immersed in samādhi … mind not immersed in samādhi … freed mind … They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Thus they recollect their many past lives, with features and details.</p>
<p class="bodytext">With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant with these ten factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.98 : A Senior Mendicant </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a senior mendicant with ten qualities lives comfortably in whatever region they live. What ten?</p>
<p class="bodytext">They are senior and have long gone forth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Both monastic codes have been passed down to them in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well judged in both the rules and accompanying material.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re skilled in raising and settling disciplinary issues.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They love the teachings and are a delight to converse with, being full of joy in the teaching and training.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re content with any kind of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They look impressive when going out and coming back, and are well restrained when sitting in an inhabited area.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A senior mendicant with these ten qualities lives comfortably in whatever region they live.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.99 : With Upāli </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Upāli went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, I wish to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Upāli, remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in it. Staying alone, the forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi. If someone should say this, ‘Though I don’t have immersion, I’m going to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ You can expect that they’ll sink down or float away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a large lake, and along comes a bull elephant with a height of seven or eight cubits. He’d think, ‘Why don’t I plunge into this lake and play around while washing my ears and back? When I’ve bathed and emerged from the water, I’ll come out and go wherever I want.’ And that’s just what he does. Why is that? Because his large life-form finds a footing in the depths.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then along comes a rabbit or a cat. They’d think, ‘What difference is there between me and a bull elephant? Why don’t I plunge into this lake and play around while washing my ears and back? When I’ve bathed and drunk, I’ll emerge from the water and go wherever I want.’ They jump into the lake rashly, without thinking. You can expect that they’ll sink down or float away. Why is that? Because their little life-form finds no footing in the depths. If someone should say this, ‘Though I don’t have immersion, I’m going to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ You can expect that they’ll sink down or float away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a little baby boy playing in his own urine and feces. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t that a totally foolish game?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“After some time that boy grows up and his faculties mature. He accordingly plays childish games such as toy plows, tip-cat, somersaults, pinwheels, toy measures, toy carts, and toy bows. What do you think, Upāli? Aren’t such games better than what he did before?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“After some time that boy grows up and his faculties mature further. He accordingly amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear … Smells known by the nose … Tastes known by the tongue … Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. What do you think, Upāli? Aren’t such games better than what he did before?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But then a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some good family. They gain faith in the Realized One, and reflect, ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They avoid injuring plants and seeds. They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. They avoid dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows. They avoid beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, perfumes, and makeup. They avoid high and luxurious beds. They avoid receiving gold and money, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. They avoid running errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, they sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. …” …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Furthermore, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, a mendicant enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, a mendicant enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …” …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. …” …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. And they have achieved their own goal. Come on, Upāli, stay with the Saṅgha. If you stay with the Saṅgha you’ll be comfortable.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.102 : Awakening Factors </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated they fulfill three knowledges. What seven? The awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. When these seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated they fulfill three knowledges. What three? It’s when a mendicant recollects their many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding.

It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.</p>

He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is holiness. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.

Then they make their beds between the boundary and the fire chamber. That night they rise three times and worship the fire with joined palms: ‘We descend, lord! We descend, lord!’ And they serve the fire with abundant ghee, oil, and butter. And when the night has passed they serve the brahmins with a variety of delicious foods.

<p class="bodytext">Now, at that time it was the sabbath. The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi had bathed his head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes. Holding a handful of fresh grass, he stood to one side not far from the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha saw him, and said, “Brahmin, why have you bathed your head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes? Why are you standing to one side holding a handful of fresh grass? What’s going on today with the brahmin clan?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, today is the ceremony of descent for the brahmin clan.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But how do the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, Master Gotama, on the sabbath the brahmins bathe their heads and dress in a new pair of linen robes. They make a heap of fresh cow dung and spread it with green grass. Then they make their beds between the boundary and the fire chamber. That night they rise three times and worship the fire with joined palms: ‘We descend, lord! We descend, lord!’ And they serve the fire with abundant ghee, oil, and butter. And when the night has passed they serve the brahmins with a variety of delicious foods. That’s how the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Yes sir,” Jāṇussoṇi replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Mahākaccāna said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail: ‘You should know bad principles and good principles … and practice accordingly.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So what are bad principles? What are good principles? What are bad results? And what are good results? Killing living creatures is a bad principle.

If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this. You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” said those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna said. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then they said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, we went to Mahākaccāna and asked him about this matter. And Mahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, mendicants! Mahākaccāna is astute, he has great wisdom. If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna. That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, you should know bad principles and good principles. And you should know bad results and good results. Knowing these things, your practice should follow the good principles with good results.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.176 : With Cunda </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Pāvā in Cunda the smith’s mango grove. Then Cunda the smith went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Cunda, whose purity do you believe in?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I believe in the purity advocated by the western brahmins draped with moss who carry pitchers, serve the sacred flame, and immerse themselves in water.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Cunda, what kind of purity do these western brahmins advocate?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The western brahmins encourage their disciples like this: ‘Please, good people, rising early you should stroke the earth from your bed. If you don’t stroke the earth, stroke fresh cow dung. If you don’t stroke fresh cow dung, stroke green grass. If you don’t stroke green grass, serve the sacred flame. If you don’t serve the sacred flame, revere the sun with joined palms. If you don’t revere the sun with joined palms, immerse yourself in water three times, including the evening.’ The western brahmins advocate this kind of purity.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The purity advocated by the western brahmins is quite different from that in the training of the noble one.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what, Master Gotama, is purity in the training of the noble one? Master Gotama, please teach me this.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Cunda replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Cunda, impurity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is impurity threefold by way of body? It’s when a certain person kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is the threefold impurity by way of body.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is impurity fourfold by way of speech? It’s when a certain person lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless. This is the fourfold impurity by way of speech.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is impurity threefold by way of mind? It’s when a certain person is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have ill will and hateful intentions: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted: ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’ This is the threefold impurity by way of mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds. When you have these ten ways of doing unskillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you’re still impure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you’re still impure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you stroke green grass, you’re still impure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you’re still impure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you’re still impure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you’re still impure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing unskillful deeds are impure and make things impure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s because of those who do these ten kinds of unskillful deeds that hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, or any other bad places are found.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Cunda, purity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is purity threefold by way of body? It’s when a certain person gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up stealing. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don’t have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is the threefold purity by way of body.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is purity fourfold by way of speech? It’s when a certain person gives up lying. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I see.’ So they don’t deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is the fourfold purity by way of speech.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is purity threefold by way of mind? It’s when a certain person is content. They don’t covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have a kind heart and loving intentions: ‘May these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have right view, an undistorted perspective: ‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There is obligation to mother and father. There are beings reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is the threefold purity by way of mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the ten ways of doing skillful deeds. When you have these ten ways of doing skillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you’re still pure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you’re still pure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you stroke green grass, you’re still pure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you’re still pure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you’re still pure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you’re still pure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing skillful deeds are pure and make things pure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s because of those who do these ten kinds of skillful deeds that gods, humans, or any other good places are found.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Cunda the smith said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.177 : With Jāṇussoṇi </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “We who are known as brahmins give gifts and perform memorial rites for the dead: ‘May this gift aid my departed relatives and family. May they partake of this gift.’ But does this gift really aid departed relatives and family? Do they actually partake of it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It aids them if the conditions are right, brahmin, but not if the conditions are wrong.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then, Master Gotama, what are the right and wrong conditions?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Brahmin, take someone who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in hell. There they survive feeding on the food of the hell beings. The conditions there are wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take someone else who kills living creatures … and has wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the animal realm. There they survive feeding on the food of the beings in the animal realm. The conditions there too are wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take someone else who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, or use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. They're contented, kind-hearted, and have right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the human realm. There they survive feeding on human food. The conditions there too are wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take someone else who doesn’t kill living creatures … and has right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods. There they survive feeding on the food of the gods. The conditions there too are wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take someone else who kills living creatures … and has wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the ghost realm. There they survive feeding on the food of the beings in the ghost realm. Or else they survive feeding on what friends and colleagues, relatives and kin provide them with from here. The conditions there are right, so the gift aids the one who lives there.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Master Gotama, who partakes of that gift if the departed relative is not reborn in that place?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Other departed relatives reborn there will partake of that gift.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But who partakes of the gift when neither that relative nor other relatives have been reborn in that place?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s impossible, brahmin, it cannot happen that that place is vacant of departed relatives in all this long time. It’s never fruitless for the donor.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Does Master Gotama propose this even when the conditions are wrong?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I propose this even when the conditions are wrong. Take someone who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. They give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of elephants. There they get to have food and drink, garlands and various adornments.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since in this life they killed living creatures … and had wrong view, they were reborn in the company of elephants. Since they gave to ascetics or brahmins … they get to have food and drink, garlands and various adornments.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take someone else who kills living creatures … and has wrong view. They give to ascetics or brahmins … When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of horses. … cattle … dogs. There they get to have food and drink, garlands and various adornments.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since in this life they killed living creatures … and had wrong view, they were reborn in the company of dogs. Since they gave to ascetics or brahmins … they get to have food and drink, garlands and various adornments.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take someone else who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. They don’t use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, with right view. They give to ascetics or brahmins … When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the human realm. There they get to have the five kinds of human sensual stimulation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since in this life they didn’t kill living creatures … and had right view, they were reborn in the company of humans. Since they gave to ascetics or brahmins … they get to have the five kinds of human sensual stimulation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take someone else who doesn’t kill living creatures … and has right view. They give to ascetics or brahmins … When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods. There they get to have the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since in this life they didn’t kill living creatures … and had right view, they were reborn in the company of the gods. Since they gave to ascetics or brahmins … they get to have the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. It’s never fruitless for the donor.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing, Just this much is quite enough to justify giving gifts and performing memorial rites for the dead, since it’s never fruitless for the donor.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, brahmin. It’s never fruitless for the donor.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p></div>

<p class="bodytext">“No, sir. For if they don’t do any bad deed, from where would suffering afflict them?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This heart’s release by equanimity should be developed by women or men. For neither women nor men take this body with them when they go. The mind is what’s inside mortal beings. They understand: ‘Whatever bad deeds I have done in the past with this deed-born body I will experience here. It will not follow me to my next life.’ The heart’s release by equanimity developed in this way leads to non-return for a wise mendicant here who has not penetrated to a higher freedom.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 10.220 : Unprincipled Conduct </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what Master Gotama has said in brief. Please, Master Gotama, teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” the brahmin replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Brahmin, unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of body? … That’s how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of body? … That’s how principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of body.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p></div>
