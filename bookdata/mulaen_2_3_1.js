<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot springs, went up to Samiddhi, and, standing in the air, addressed him in verse:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Mendicant, you seek alms before you eat; </p>
<p class="gatha">you wouldn’t seek alms after eating. </p>
<p class="gatha">But you should eat first, then seek alms: </p>

<p class="gatha">it’s hidden and unseen. </p>
<p class="gatha">That’s why I seek alms before eating, </p>
<p class="gatha">so that the time may not pass me by!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that deity landed on the ground and said to Samiddhi, “You’ve gone forth while young, mendicant. You’re black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures. Enjoy human sensual pleasures! Don’t give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’m not, good sir; I’m giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present. For the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks. But this teaching is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But in what way, mendicant, has the Buddha said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks? And how is this teaching visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’m junior, good sir, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. I’m not able to explain this in detail. But the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery. You should go to him and ask about this matter. And you should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s not easy for us to approach the Buddha, as he is surrounded by other illustrious deities. If you go to the Buddha and ask him about this matter, we’ll come along and listen to the teaching.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, good sir,” Venerable Samiddhi replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, if that deity spoke the truth, he’ll be close by.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he had spoken, that deity said to Samiddhi, “Ask, mendicant, ask! For I have arrived.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha addressed the deity in verse:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Sentient beings who perceive the visible, </p>
<p class="gatha">become established in the visible. </p>
<p class="gatha">Not understanding the visible, </p>

<p class="bodytext">“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”</p>

<p class="gatha">special, or worse’, you’ll get into arguments. </p>
<p class="gatha">Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations, </p>
<p class="gatha">you’ll have no thought ‘I’m equal or special’. </p>
<p class="gatha">Tell me if you understand, spirit.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Judging is given up, conceit rejected; </p>
<p class="gatha">craving for name and form is cut off right here. </p>
<p class="gatha">They’ve cut the ties, untroubled and free of hope. </p>
<p class="gatha">Though gods and humans search for them </p>
<p class="gatha">in this world and the world beyond, they never find them, </p>
<p class="gatha">not in heaven nor in any abode.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Tell me if you understand, spirit.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“You should never do anything bad </p>
<p class="gatha">by speech or mind or body in all the world. </p>
<p class="gatha">Having given up sensual pleasures, mindful and aware, </p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi deer park.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the Buddha’s foot had been cut by a splinter. The Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable. But he endured with mindfulness and situational awareness, without worrying. And then he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group, lighting up the entire Maddukucchi, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Standing to one side, one deity was inspired to exclaim in the Buddha’s presence: “The ascetic Gotama is such an elephant, sir! And as an elephant, he endures painful physical feelings that have come up—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable—with mindfulness and situational awareness, without worrying.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then another deity was inspired to exclaim in the Buddha’s presence: “The ascetic Gotama is such a lion, sir! And as a lion, he endures painful physical feelings … without worrying.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then another deity was inspired to exclaim in the Buddha’s presence: “The ascetic Gotama is such a behemoth, sir! And as a behemoth, he endures painful physical feelings … without worrying.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then another deity was inspired to exclaim in the Buddha’s presence: “The ascetic Gotama is truly tamed, sir! And as someone tamed, he endures painful physical feelings … without worrying.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then another deity was inspired to exclaim in the Buddha’s presence: “See, his immersion is so well developed, and his mind is so well freed—not leaning forward or pulling back, and not held in place by forceful suppression. If anyone imagines that they can overcome such an elephant of a man, a lion of a man, a thoroughbred of a man, a chief bull of a man, a behemoth of a man, a tamed man—what is that but a failure to see?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then, late at night, several glorious gods lit up the entire Bamboo Grove. They were Asama, Sahalī, Niṅka, Ākoṭaka, Vetambarī, and Māṇavagāmiya, and all of them were disciples of various sectarian teachers. They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, the god Asama recited this verse about Pūraṇa Kassapa in the Buddha’s presence:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In injuring and killing here,  </p>
<p class="gatha">in beating and extortion,  </p>
<p class="gatha">Kassapa saw no evil,  </p>

<p class="gatha">What he taught should truly be trusted,  </p>
<p class="gatha">he’s worthy of esteem as Teacher.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the god Sahalī recited this verse about Makkhali Gosala in the Buddha’s presence:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Through mortification in disgust of sin he became well restrained.  </p>
<p class="gatha">He gave up arguing with people.  </p>
<p class="gatha">Refraining from false speech, he spoke the truth.  </p>
<p class="gatha">Surely such a man does no wrong!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the god Niṅka recited this verse about Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in the Buddha’s presence:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Disgusted at sin, a self-disciplined mendicant,  </p>
<p class="gatha">well restrained in the four controls;  </p>
<p class="gatha">explaining what is seen and heard:  </p>
<p class="gatha">surely he can be no sinner!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the god Ākoṭaka recited this verse about various sectarian teachers in the Buddha’s presence:</p>

<p class="gatha">Teachers of communities, attained ascetics,  </p>
<p class="gatha">surely they weren’t far from truly good men!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the god Vetambarī replied to the god Ākoṭaka in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Though the wretched jackal howls along,  </p>
<p class="gatha">it never equals the lion.  </p>
<p class="gatha">A naked liar with suspicious conduct,  </p>
<p class="gatha">though they teach a community, doesn’t resemble the good.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Māra the Wicked took possession of the god Vetambarī and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: “Does Master Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening?” “If anyone should rightly be said to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, it’s me. For, great king, I have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and teach a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. That is, Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala. I also asked them whether they claimed to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, but they made no such claim. So why do you, given that you’re so young in age and newly gone forth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Great king, these four things should not be looked down on or disparaged because they are young. What four? An aristocrat, a snake, a fire, and a mendicant. These four things should not be looked down on or disparaged because they are young.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“A man should not despise  </p>
<p class="gatha">an aristocrat of impeccable lineage,  </p>

<p class="bodytext">When this was said, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Buddha: “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their nails were long; and they carried their stuff with shoulder-poles. Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward those various ascetics, and pronounced his name three times. “Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!

Now at that time five kings headed by Pasenadi were amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and this discussion came up among them: “What’s the best of sensual pleasures?” Some of them said: “Sights are the best of sensual pleasures!” Others said: “Sounds are best!” Others said: “Smells are best!” Others said: “Tastes are best!” Others said: “Touches are best!” Since those kings were unable to convince each other,</p>
<p class="bodytext">King Pasenadi said to them: “Come, good sirs, let’s go to the Buddha and ask him about this. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” “Yes, dear sir,” replied those kings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those five kings headed by Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. King Pasenadi reported their conversation to the Buddha, and said: “Sir, what’s the best of sensual pleasures?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Great king, which kind of sensual stimulation is best is defined by which is most agreeable, I say. The very same sights that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others. When you’re happy with certain sights, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other sight that’s better or finer. For you, those sights are perfect and supreme.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The very same sounds …</p>
<p class="bodytext">smells …</p>
<p class="bodytext">tastes …</p>
<p class="bodytext">touches that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others. When you’re happy with certain touches, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other touch that’s better or finer. For you, those touches are perfect and supreme.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the lay follower Candanaṅgalika was sitting in that assembly. Then he got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: “I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” “Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the lay follower Candanaṅgalika extolled the Buddha in his presence with an appropriate verse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Like a fragrant pink lotus  </p>
<p class="gatha">that blooms in the morning, its fragrance unfaded— </p>
<p class="gatha">see Aṅgīrasa shine,  </p>
<p class="gatha">bright as the sun in the sky!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those five kings clothed Candanaṅgalika with five upper robes. And Candanaṅgalika in turn endowed the Buddha with these robes.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">13. A Bucket of Rice</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī. Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala used to eat rice by the bucket. Then after eating King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, huffing and puffing. He bowed and sat down to one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after eating, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When a man is always mindful,  </p>
<p class="gatha">knowing moderation in eating,  </p>
<p class="gatha">his discomfort diminishes,  </p>
<p class="gatha">and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the brahmin student Sudassana was standing behind the king. Then King Pasenadi addressed him: “Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this verse in the Buddha’s presence and recite it to me whenever I am presented with a meal. I’ll set up a regular daily allowance of a hundred dollars for you.” “Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Sudassana. He memorized that verse in the Buddha’s presence, and then whenever the king was presented with a meal he would repeat it:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When a man is always mindful,  </p>
<p class="gatha">knowing moderation in eating,  </p>
<p class="gatha">his discomfort diminishes,  </p>
<p class="gatha">and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the king gradually got used to having no more than a pint of rice. After some time King Pasenadi’s body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs with his hands, at that time he spoke these words of inspiration: “The Buddha truly has compassion for me in both the good of the present life and the good of the next life.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī. Then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala. When King Pasenadi heard of this, he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu. Then the two kings met in battle. And in that battle Ajātasattu defeated Pasenadi, who withdrew to his own capital at Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then, after the meal, when they returned from alms-round, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then the Buddha said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, King Ajātasattu has bad friends, companions, and associates. But King Pasenadi has good friends, companions, and associates. Yet on this day King Pasenadi will have a bad night’s sleep as one defeated.” That is what the Buddha said. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Victory gives rise to enmity;  </p>

When King Pasenadi heard of this, he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu. Then the two kings met in battle. And in that battle Pasenadi defeated Ajātasattu and captured him alive. Then King Pasenadi thought: “Even though I’ve never betrayed this King Ajātasattu, he betrayed me. Still, he is my nephew. Now that I’ve vanquished all of Ajātasattu’s elephant troops, cavalry, chariots, and infantry, why don’t I let him loose with just his life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And that’s what he did.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several mendicants … told the Buddha what had happened.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“So what is it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Diligence, great king, is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.

<h3 class="subhead">18. Good Friends</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī. Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha: “Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha. But it’s for someone with good friends, companions, and associates, not for someone with bad friends, companions, and associates.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Great king, this one time I was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Nagaraka. Then the mendicant Ānanda came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said: ‘Sir, good friends, companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he had spoken, I said to him: ‘Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life. A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path? It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things. This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, great king, you should train like this: ‘I will have good friends, companions, and associates.’ That’s how you should train.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you have good friends, companions, and associates, you should live supported by one thing: diligence in skillful qualities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you’re diligent, supported by diligence, your ladies of the harem,</p>
<p class="bodytext">aristocrat vassals,</p>
<p class="bodytext">troops,</p>
<p class="bodytext">and people of town and country will think: ‘The king lives diligently, supported by diligence. We’d better live diligently, supported by diligence!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you’re diligent, supported by diligence, then not only you yourself, but your ladies of the harem, and your treasury and storehouses will be guarded and protected.” That is what the Buddha said. …</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha in the middle of the day, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: “So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed away. Since he died childless, I have come after transferring his fortune to the royal compound. There was eight million in gold, not to speak of the silver. And yet that financier ate meals of rough gruel with pickles. He wore clothes consisting of three pieces of sunn hemp. He traveled around in a vehicle that was a dilapidated little cart, holding a leaf as sunshade.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! When a bad person has acquired exceptional wealth they don’t make themselves happy and pleased. Nor do they make their mother and father, partners and children, bondservants, workers, and staff, and friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they don’t establish an uplifting teacher’s offering for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. Because they haven’t made proper use of that wealth, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. Since that wealth is not properly utilized, it’s wasted, not used.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a lotus pond in an uninhabited region with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. But people don’t collect it or drink it or bathe in it or use it for any purpose. Since that water is not properly utilized, it’s wasted, not used. In the same way, when a bad person has acquired exceptional wealth … it’s wasted, not used.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! Once upon a time, great king, that financier householder provided alms-food on behalf of a Buddha awakened for himself named Tagarasikhī. He instructed: ‘Give alms to that ascetic,’ before getting up from his seat and leaving. But after giving he regretted it: ‘It would have been better to feed the bondservants or workers with that alms-food.’ What’s more, he murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Because that financier provided Tagarasikhī with alms-food, as a result of that deed he was reborn seven times in a good place, a heavenly realm. And as a residual result of that same deed he held the position of financier seven times right here in Sāvatthī. But because that financier regretted giving alms, as a result of that deed his mind didn’t tend to enjoy nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. And because that financier murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune, as a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. And as a residual result of that same deed for the seventh time, since he is childless, his fortune ends up in the royal treasury. Now the old merit of that financier has been used up, and he hasn’t accumulated new merit. Today, great king, that financier burns in the Great Hell of Screams.” “So, sir, that financier has been reborn in the Great Hell of Screams?” “Yes he has, great king.” That is what the Buddha said. …</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, my grandmother has passed away. She was old, elderly and senior. She was advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life; she was a hundred and twenty years old. But I loved my grandmother; she was dear to me. If by giving away the elephant treasure I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it. If by giving away the horse treasure I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it. If by giving away a prize village I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it. If by giving away the whole country I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it.” “Great king, all sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.” “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how well said this was by the Buddha: ‘All sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! All sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death. It’s like the vessels made by potters. Whatever kind they are, whether baked or unbaked, all of them are liable to break apart. Breaking is their end; they’re not exempt from breakage. In the same way, all sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.” That is what the Buddha said. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“All beings will die,  </p>
<p class="gatha">for life ends with death.  </p>
<p class="gatha">They pass on according to their deeds,  </p>
<p class="gatha">reaping the fruits of good and bad.  </p>
<p class="gatha">Those who do bad go to hell,  </p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī. Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha: “Sir, how many things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort?” “Great king, three things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion. These three things arise in the world for its harm, suffering, and discomfort.” That is what the Buddha said. …</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī. Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha: “Sir, where should a gift be given?” “Wherever your heart feels inspired, great king.” “But sir, where is a gift very fruitful?” “Where a gift should be given is one thing, great king, but where a gift is very fruitful is another. A gift is very fruitful when it’s given to an ethical person, not so much to an unethical person. Well then, great king, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, great king? Suppose you were at war, ready to fight a battle. Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is untrained, inexpert, unfit, inexperienced. And he’s fearful, cowardly, trembling, quick to flee. Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?” “No, sir, I would have no use for such a man.” “What about a brahmin youth, a merchant youth, or a worker youth who was similar?” “No, sir, I would have no use for such a man.”</p>

Would he be of any use to you?” “Yes, sir, I would have a use for such a man.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, a gift to anyone who has given up five factors and possesses five factors is very fruitful, no matter what family they’ve gone forth from. What are the five factors they’ve given up? Sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These are the five factors they’ve given up. What are the five factors they possess? The entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge and vision of freedom. These are the five factors they possess. I say that a gift to anyone who has given up these five factors and possesses these five factors is very fruitful.” That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Any youth skilled at archery,  </p>
<p class="gatha">powerful and vigorous,  </p>
<p class="gatha">would be employed by a king going to war— </p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī. King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him: “So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” “Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with power, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory. Today I have been busy fulfilling the duties of such kings.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the east. He’d approach you and say: ‘Please sir, you should know this. I come from the east. There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. So then, great king, do what you must!’ Then a second trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the west … a third from the north … and a fourth from the south. He’d approach you and say: ‘Please sir, you should know this. I come from the south. There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. So then, great king, do what you must!’ Should such a dire threat arise—a terrible loss of human life, when human birth is so rare—what would you do?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, what could I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I tell you, great king, I announce to you: old age and death are advancing upon you. Since old age and death are advancing upon you, what would you do?” “Sir, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions? Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with power, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory. Such kings engage in battles of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or infantry. But there is no place, no scope for such battles when old age and death are advancing. In this royal court there are ministers of wise counsel who are capable of dividing an approaching enemy by wise counsel. But there is no place, no scope for such diplomatic battles when old age and death are advancing. In this royal court there is abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. Using this wealth we can pay off an approaching enemy. But there is no place, no scope for such monetary battles when old age and death are advancing. When old age and death are advancing, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! When old age and death are advancing, what can you do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>

The Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable. But he endured with mindfulness and situational awareness, without worrying. And then he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware.

He went up to those mendicants and said: “You’ve gone forth while young, reverends. You’re black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures. Enjoy human sensual pleasures. Don’t give up what you see in the present life to chase after what takes time.” “Brahmin, that’s not what we’re doing. We’re giving up what takes time to chase after what we see in the present life. For the Buddha says that sensual pleasures take time; they give much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. But this teaching is realizable in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.” When they had spoken, Māra the Wicked shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and departed leaning on his staff.</p>

<p class="gatha">He’s not easily seduced by lust.  </p>
<p class="gatha">He has gone beyond Māra’s dominion;  </p>
<p class="gatha">that’s why I’m so upset.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">For if we had come on to any ascetic or brahmin like this who was not free of lust, his heart would explode, or he’d spew hot blood from his mouth, or he’d go mad and lose his mind. He’d dry up, wither away, and shrivel up like a green reed that was mowed down.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side. Māra’s daughter Craving addressed the Buddha in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Are you overwhelmed by sorrow that you meditate in the forest?  </p>
<p class="gatha">Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one?  </p>
<p class="gatha">Or perhaps you’ve committed some crime in the village?  </p>
<p class="gatha">Why don’t you get too close to people?  </p>
<p class="gatha">And why does no-one get close to you?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’ve reached the goal, peace of heart.  </p>
<p class="gatha">Having conquered the army of the likable and pleasant,  </p>
<p class="gatha">alone, practicing absorption, I awakened to bliss.  </p>
<p class="gatha">That’s why I don’t get too close to people,  </p>
<p class="gatha">and no-one gets too close to me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Māra’s daughter Delight addressed the Buddha in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“How does a mendicant who has crossed five floods  </p>
<p class="gatha">usually meditate here while crossing the sixth?  </p>
<p class="gatha">How do they usually practice absorption so that sensual perceptions  </p>
<p class="gatha">are warded off and don’t get hold of them?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“With tranquil body and mind well freed,  </p>
<p class="gatha">without making plans, mindful, homeless;  </p>
<p class="gatha">understanding the teaching, they practice absorption without placing the mind;  </p>
<p class="gatha">they’re not shaking or drifting or rigid.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how a mendicant who has crossed five floods  </p>
<p class="gatha">usually meditates here while crossing the sixth.  </p>
<p class="gatha">That’s how they usually practice absorption so that sensual perceptions  </p>
<p class="gatha">are warded off and don’t get hold of them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Māra’s daughter Lust addressed the Buddha in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He lives with his community after cutting off craving,  </p>
<p class="gatha">and many of the faithful will cross over for sure.  </p>
<p class="gatha">Alas, this homeless one will snatch many men away,  </p>
<p class="gatha">and lead them past the King of Death!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The great heroes they lead  </p>
<p class="gatha">by means of the true teaching.  </p>
<p class="gatha">When the Realized Ones are leading by the teaching,  </p>
<p class="gatha">how could anyone who knows be jealous?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Māra’s daughters Craving, Delight, and Lust went up to Māra the Wicked. Māra the Wicked saw them coming off in the distance, and addressed them in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Fools! You drill into a mountain  </p>
<p class="gatha">with lotus stalks!  </p>
<p class="gatha">You dig up a hill with your nails!  </p>
<p class="gatha">You chew iron with your teeth!</p>
<p class="bodytext">You seek a footing in the deeps, as it were,  </p>
<p class="gatha">while lifting a rock with your head!  </p>
<p class="gatha">After attacking a stump with your breast, as it were,  </p>
<p class="gatha">you leave Gotama disappointed.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“They came in their splendor— </p>
<p class="gatha">Craving, Delight, and Lust.  </p>
<p class="gatha">But the Teacher brushed them off right there,  </p>
<p class="gatha">like the breeze, a fallen tuft.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the nun Āḷavikā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from alms-round, she went to the Dark Forest seeking seclusion. Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Āḷavikā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from seclusion, went up to her and addressed her in verse:</p>

<h3 class="subhead">1. The Appeal of Brahmā</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: “This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of reason, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.” And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’ve struggled hard to realize this,  </p>
<p class="gatha">enough with trying to explain it!  </p>
<p class="gatha">This principle is not easily understood  </p>
<p class="gatha">by those mired in greed and hate.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Those caught up in greed can’t see  </p>
<p class="gatha">what’s subtle, going against the stream,  </p>
<p class="gatha">deep, hard to see, and very fine,  </p>
<p class="gatha">for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, thought: “Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.” Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: “Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. There will be those who understand the teaching!” This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past  </p>
<p class="gatha">an impure teaching thought up by those still stained.  </p>
<p class="gatha">Fling open the door to the deathless!  </p>
<p class="gatha">Let them hear the teaching the stainless one discovered.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings. And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the flaw to do with the next world, while others did not. It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the flaw to do with the next world, while others did not. When he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Flung open are the doors to the deathless!  </p>
<p class="gatha">Let those with ears to hear decide their faith.  </p>
<p class="gatha">Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, I did not teach  </p>
<p class="gatha">the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">2. Respect</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: “It’s unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to him: “I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the full spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the full spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion …</p>
<p class="bodytext">I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the full spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom …</p>

<p class="bodytext">I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the full spectrum of the knowledge and vision of freedom, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom, who I should honor and respect and rely on. Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching. All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching. May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.” This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“All Buddhas in the past,  </p>
<p class="gatha">the Buddhas of the future,  </p>
<p class="gatha">and the Buddha at present— </p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which people from good families rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Wandering indiscriminately for alms-food in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother’s house. Now at that time Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, was offering up a regular oblation to Brahmā. Then Brahmā Sahampati thought: “This Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, offers up a regular oblation to Brahmā. Why don’t I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her?” Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the house of Brahmadeva’s mother. Then Brahmā Sahampati, while standing in the air, addressed Brahmadeva’s mother in verse:</p>

Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable. And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.

But such and such Brahmā realm is successful and prosperous, while the Brahmā living there is negligent. Come, let’s go to that Brahmā realm and inspire awe in that Brahmā!” “Yes, good sir,” replied Suddhāvāsa.</p>

Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they had spoken, that Brahmā refused to accept their advice. He multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā: “Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?” “I see that, good sir.” “Since I have such psychic power and might, what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to and attend upon?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and said to that Brahmā: “Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?” “I see that, good sir.” “That Buddha has even more psychic power and might than you or me. Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?” Then that Brahmā addressed Subrahmā in verse:</p>

They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika: “Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha: “Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” For a second time, the Buddha said to Kokālika: “Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha: “Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika: “Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him: “Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha: “Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” “It’s long, mendicant. It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” “But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” “It’s possible,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell. The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” That is what the Buddha said.

<h3 class="subhead">14. About Aruṇavatī</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī. There he addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants!” “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Aruṇavā. He had a capital named Aruṇavatī. Sikhī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī. Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava. Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū: ‘Come, brahmin, let’s go to one of the brahmā realms until it’s time for our meal.’ ‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from Aruṇavatī and appeared in that Brahmā realm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū: ‘Brahmin, teach the Dhamma as you feel inspired for that Brahmā, his assembly, and the members of his retinue.’ ‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. But the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled, and objected: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! How on earth can a disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū: ‘Brahmin, Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue are complaining that a disciple teaches Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher. Well then, brahmin, stir them up even more!’ ‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he taught Dhamma with his body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower half invisible. And the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī: ‘Sir, I recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha: “Standing in the Brahmā realm, I can make my voice heard throughout the galaxy.”’ ‘Now is the time, brahmin! Now is the time, brahmin! Standing in the Brahmā realm, make your voice heard throughout the galaxy.’ ‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Standing in the Brahmā realm, he recited this verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Rouse yourselves! Try harder!  </p>
<p class="gatha">Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!  </p>
<p class="gatha">Crush the army of Death,  </p>
<p class="gatha">like an elephant crushes a hut of reeds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whoever will live diligently  </p>
<p class="gatha">in this teaching and training,  </p>
<p class="gatha">giving up transmigration through rebirths,  </p>
<p class="gatha">will make an end of suffering.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Having inspired that Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue with a sense of awe, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from that Brahmā realm and appeared in Aruṇavatī. Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants: ‘Mendicants, did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a verse while standing in a Brahmā realm?’ ‘We did, sir.’ ‘But what exactly did you hear?’ ‘This is what we heard, sir:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Rouse yourselves! Try harder!  </p>
<p class="gatha">Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!  </p>
<p class="gatha">Crush the army of Death,  </p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his final extinguishment. Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: “Come now, mendicants, I say to you all: ‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’” These were the Realized One’s last words.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished. When the Buddha became fully extinguished, along with the full extinguishment, Brahmā Sahampati recited this verse:</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time a certain brahmin lady of the Bhāradvāja clan named Dhanañjānī was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. Once, while she was bringing her husband his meal she tripped and was inspired to exclaim three times:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!</p>
<p class="bodytext">Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!</p>
<p class="bodytext">Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When she said this, the brahmin said to Dhanañjānī:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’d be right. For the slightest thing this wretched lady spouts out praise for that bald ascetic. Right now, wretched woman, I’m going to refute your teacher’s doctrine!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can refute the doctrine of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. But anyway, you should go. When you’ve gone you’ll understand.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, angry and upset, went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and addressed the Buddha in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When what is incinerated do you sleep at ease? </p>
<p class="gatha">When what is incinerated is there no sorrow? </p>
<p class="gatha">What is the one thing </p>

<p class="gatha">and a honey tip. </p>
<p class="gatha">The noble ones praise its killing, </p>
<p class="gatha">for when it’s incinerated there is no sorrow.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, brahmin? Do friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, and guests still come to visit you?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sometimes they do, Master Gotama.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">9. With Bhāradvāja of Sundarika</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarika river.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarika was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the river Sundarika.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then he looked all around the four directions, wondering, “Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head. Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha. When he heard Sundarika’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sundarika thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But he thought, “Even some brahmins are shaven. Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sundarika the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and said to him, “Sir, in what caste were you born?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Don’t ask about birth, ask about conduct. </p>
<p class="gatha">For any wood can surely generate fire. </p>
<p class="gatha">A steadfast sage, even though from a low class family, </p>
<p class="gatha">is a thoroughbred checked by conscience.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Tamed by truth, fulfilled by taming, </p>
<p class="gatha">a complete knowledge master who has completed the spiritual journey— </p>
<p class="gatha">that’s who a sacrificer should introduce themselves to, </p>
<p class="gatha">and make a timely offering to one worthy of a religious donation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“My sacrificial offering must have been well performed, </p>
<p class="gatha">since I have met such a knowledge master! </p>
<p class="gatha">It’s because I’d never met anyone like you </p>
<p class="gatha">that others ate the leftover offering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Eat, Master Gotama, you are truly a brahmin.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. </p>
<p class="gatha">That’s not the way of those who see, brahmin. </p>
<p class="gatha">The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. </p>
<p class="gatha">Since nature is real, brahmin, that’s how they live.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Serve with other food and drink </p>
<p class="gatha">the consummate one, the great hermit, </p>
<p class="gatha">with defilements ended and remorse stilled. </p>
<p class="gatha">For he is the field for the seeker of merit.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then, Master Gotama, to whom should I give the leftovers of this offering?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest these leftovers, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples. Well then, brahmin, throw out those leftovers where there is little that grows, or drop them into water that has no living creatures.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So Sundarika dropped the leftover offering in water that had no living creatures. And when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming and fuming. In the same way, when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sundarika the brahmin, shocked and awestruck, went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side. The Buddha addressed him in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When you’re kindling the wood, brahmin, </p>
<p class="gatha">don’t imagine this is purity, for it’s just an external. </p>
<p class="gatha">Experts say that those who wish for purity </p>
<p class="gatha">through externals will not find it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I’ve given up kindling firewood, brahmin, </p>
<p class="gatha">now I just light the inner flame. </p>
<p class="gatha">Always blazing, always serene, </p>
<p class="gatha">I am a perfected one living the spiritual life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Conceit, brahmin, is the burden of your possessions, </p>
<p class="gatha">anger your smoke, and lies your ashes. </p>
<p class="gatha">The tongue is the ladle and the heart the fire altar; </p>
<p class="gatha">a well-tamed self is a person’s light.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin, </p>
<p class="gatha">unclouded, praised by the fine to the good. </p>
<p class="gatha">There the knowledge-masters go to bathe, </p>
<p class="gatha">and cross to the far shore without getting wet.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Truth, principle, restraint, the spiritual life; </p>
<p class="gatha">the attainment of the supreme based on the middle, brahmin. </p>
<p class="gatha">Pay homage to the straightforward ones— </p>
<p class="gatha">I declare that man to be one who follows the teaching.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarika said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama …” … And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time one of the brahmins of the Bhāradvāja clan had lost fourteen oxen. While looking for them he went to that forest, where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. He went up to the Buddha, and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence:</p>

<p class="bodytext">When he had spoken, the brahmin said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the brahmin received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing. Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food. Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms and said to him, “I plough and sow, ascetic, and then I eat. You too should plough and sow, then you may eat.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t see Master Gotama with a yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen, yet he says: ‘I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.’”</p>

<p class="bodytext">But when he had filled the Buddha’s bowl for a third time, he said to the Buddha, “This insatiable ascetic Gotama keeps coming back again and again!”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then Stuck-Up thought, “The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. Why don’t I approach him? If he speaks to me, I’ll speak to him. But if he doesn’t speak, neither will I.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the brahmin Stuck-Up went up to the Buddha, and stood silently to one side. But the Buddha didn’t speak to him.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then that assembly was stunned: “It’s incredible, it’s amazing! This brahmin Stuck-Up doesn’t bow to his mother or father, his teacher, or his oldest brother. Yet he shows such utmost devotion to the ascetic Gotama!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to the brahmin Stuck-Up, “Enough, brahmin. Get up, and take your own seat. For your mind has confidence in me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Stuck-Up took his seat and said to the Buddha:</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several youths, students of one of the Bhāradvāja brahmins, approached a forest grove while collecting firewood. They saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged at the root of a certain sal tree, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there. Seeing this, they went up to Bhāradvāja and said to him, “Please sir, you should know this. In such and such a forest grove the ascetic Gotama is sitting down cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Bhāradvāja together with those students went to that forest grove where he saw the Buddha sitting down cross-legged, with his body straight, and mindfulness established right there.</p>

It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely. Speech with these four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred monks, all of whom were perfected ones. Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them: “Come now, monks, I invite you all: Is there anything I’ve done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he had spoken, Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: “There is nothing, sir, that you’ve done by way of body or speech that we would criticize. For the Blessed One is the one who gave rise to the unarisen path, who gave birth to the unborn path, who explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path. And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later. And sir, I invite the Blessed One. Is there anything I’ve done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is nothing, Sāriputta, that you’ve done by way of body or speech that I would criticize. Sāriputta, you are astute. You have great wisdom, widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, penetrating wisdom. A wheel-turning monarch’s oldest son rightly keeps wielding the power set in motion by his father. In the same way, Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Since it seems I have done nothing worthy of the Blessed One’s criticism, is there anything these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that you would criticize?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is nothing, Sāriputta, that these five hundred monks have done by way of body or speech that I would criticize. For of these five hundred monks, sixty have the three knowledges, sixty have the six direct knowledges, sixty are freed both ways, and the rest are freed by wisdom.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, “I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">1. With Suvīra</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Once upon a time, mendicants, the demons marched against the gods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Suvīra, ‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods! Go, and march against the demons!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But he fell into negligence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time Sakka addressed Suvīra, ‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods! Go, and march against the demons!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But for a second time he fell into negligence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time Sakka addressed Suvīra, ‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods! Go, and march against the demons!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But for a third time he fell into negligence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sakka addressed the god Suvīra in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Suvīra, go to that place </p>
<p class="gatha">where you can achieve happiness </p>
<p class="gatha">without working for it or trying hard— </p>
<p class="gatha">and take me with you!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘That a lazy man who does no work, </p>
<p class="gatha">and doesn’t do his duty, </p>
<p class="gatha">should fulfill all his desires: </p>
<p class="gatha">Sakka, grant me this boon!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Suvīra, go to that place </p>
<p class="gatha">where a lazy man who does no work </p>
<p class="gatha">prospers in unending happiness— </p>
<p class="gatha">and take me with you!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘O Sakka, best of gods, </p>
<p class="gatha">that we might find the happiness </p>
<p class="gatha">that’s sorrowless, unstressed: </p>
<p class="gatha">Sakka, grant me this boon!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘If there exists anyone anywhere </p>
<p class="gatha">who can can live happily without working, </p>
<p class="gatha">that surely would be extinguishment’s path! </p>
<p class="gatha">Go there, Suvīra, </p>
<p class="gatha">and take me with you!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of initiative and energy. But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and realize the unrealized!”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">3. The Banner’s Crest</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Good sirs, when the gods are fighting, if you get scared or terrified, just look up at my banner’s crest. Then your fear and terror will go away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you can’t see my banner’s crest, then look up at the banner’s crest of Pajāpati, king of gods. Then your fear and terror will go away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you can’t see his banner’s crest, then look up at the banner’s crest of Varuṇa, king of gods. Then your fear and terror will go away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you can’t see his banner’s crest, then look up at the banner’s crest of Īsāna, king of gods. Then your fear and terror will go away.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">However, when they look up at those banner’s crests their fear and terror might go away or it might not.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Why is that? Because Sakka is not free of greed, hate, and delusion. He gets fearful, scared, terrified, and runs away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But, mendicants, I say this: If you’ve gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified, just recollect me: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Then your fear and terror will go away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you can’t recollect me, then recollect the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ Then your fear and terror will go away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you can’t recollect the teaching, then recollect the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ Then your fear and terror will go away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Why is that? Because the Realized One is free of greed, hate, and delusion. He does not get fearful, scared, terrified, or run away.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the wilderness, at a tree’s root, </p>
<p class="gatha">or an empty hut, O mendicants, </p>
<p class="gatha">recollect the Buddha, </p>
<p class="gatha">and no fear will come to you.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you can’t recollect the Buddha— </p>
<p class="gatha">the eldest in the world, the bull of a man— </p>
<p class="gatha">then recollect the teaching, </p>
<p class="gatha">emancipating, well taught.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you can’t recollect the teaching— </p>
<p class="gatha">emancipating, well taught— </p>
<p class="gatha">then recollect the Saṅgha, </p>
<p class="gatha">the supreme field of merit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Thus recollecting the Buddha, </p>
<p class="gatha">the teaching, and the Saṅgha, mendicants, </p>
<p class="gatha">fear and terror </p>
<p class="gatha">and goosebumps will be no more.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">4. With Vepacitti</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, addressed the demons, ‘My good sirs, if the demons defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the castle of demons.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, ‘My good sirs, if the gods defeat the demons in this battle, bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. So the gods of the Thirty-Three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakka’s presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And as Sakka was entering and leaving the hall, Vepacitti abused and insulted him with rude, harsh words. So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse,</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘O Maghavā, O Sakka, </p>
<p class="gatha">is it from fear or from weakness </p>
<p class="gatha">that you put up with such harsh words </p>
<p class="gatha">in the presence of Vepacitti?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘It’s not out of fear or weakness </p>
<p class="gatha">that I’m patient with Vepacitti. </p>
<p class="gatha">For how can a sensible person like me </p>
<p class="gatha">get in a fight with a fool?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Fools would vent even more </p>
<p class="gatha">if there’s no-one to put a stop to them. </p>
<p class="gatha">So a wise one should stop </p>
<p class="gatha">a fool with forceful punishment.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘I think that this is the only way </p>
<p class="gatha">to put a stop to a fool, </p>
<p class="gatha">when you know that the other is upset, </p>
<p class="gatha">be mindful and stay calm.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘I see this fault, Vāsava, </p>
<p class="gatha">in just being patient. </p>
<p class="gatha">When a fool thinks, </p>
<p class="gatha">“He puts up with me out of fear,” </p>
<p class="gatha">the idiot will go after you even harder, </p>
<p class="gatha">like a cow chasing someone who runs away.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Let him think this if he wishes, or not— </p>
<p class="gatha">“He puts up with me out of fear.” </p>
<p class="gatha">Of goals culminating in one’s own good, </p>
<p class="gatha">none better than patience is found.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a strong person </p>
<p class="gatha">puts up with a weakling, </p>
<p class="gatha">they call that the ultimate patience, </p>
<p class="gatha">for a weakling must always be patient.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The strength of folly </p>
<p class="gatha">is really just weakness, they say. </p>
<p class="gatha">But no-one can challenge a person </p>
<p class="gatha">who’s strong, guarded by the teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you get angry at an angry person </p>
<p class="gatha">you just make things worse for yourself. </p>
<p class="gatha">When you don’t get angry at an angry person </p>
<p class="gatha">you win a battle hard to win.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you know that the other is angry, </p>
<p class="gatha">you act for the good of both </p>
<p class="gatha">yourself and the other </p>
<p class="gatha">if you’re mindful and stay calm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">People unfamiliar with the teaching </p>
<p class="gatha">consider one who heals both </p>
<p class="gatha">oneself and the other </p>
<p class="gatha">to be a fool.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of patience and gentleness. But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to be patient and gentle!”</p>

<p class="bodytext">‘Vepacitti, let there be victory by fine words!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the gods and the demons appointed a panel of judges, saying, ‘These will understand our good and bad statements.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, said to Sakka, lord of gods, ‘Lord of gods, recite a verse!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Sakka said to him, ‘Vepacitti, you are the elder god here. Recite a verse.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So Vepacitti recited this verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Fools would vent even more </p>

<p class="gatha">So an intelligent person should stop </p>

<p class="bodytext">Sakka took off his boots, gave his sword to others, and, putting down his sunshade, entered the hermitage through a gate he happened upon. He stood downwind of those hermits, revering them with joined palms.</p>

<p class="gatha">don’t get angry at angry people. </p>
<p class="gatha">Kindness and harmlessness </p>
<p class="gatha">are always present in the noble ones. </p>
<p class="gatha">For anger crushes bad people </p>
<p class="gatha">like a mountain.’”</p>
