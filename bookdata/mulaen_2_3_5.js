<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, ignorance precedes the attainment of unskillful qualities, with lack of conscience and prudence following along. An ignoramus, sunk in ignorance, gives rise to wrong view. Wrong view gives rise to wrong thought. Wrong thought gives rise to wrong speech. Wrong speech gives rise to wrong action. Wrong action gives rise to wrong livelihood. Wrong livelihood gives rise to wrong effort. Wrong effort gives rise to wrong mindfulness. Wrong mindfulness gives rise to wrong immersion.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">2. Half the Spiritual Life</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Nagaraka. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, good friends, companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life. A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path? It’s when a mendicant develops right view, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. They develop right thought … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right effort … right mindfulness … right immersion, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life. For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things. This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">4. Regarding the Brahmin Jāṇussoṇi</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. He saw the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi driving out of Sāvatthī in a splendid all-white chariot drawn by mares. The yoked horses were pure white, as were the ornaments, chariot, upholstery, reins, goad, and canopy. And his turban, robes, sandals were white, as was the chowry fanning him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When people saw it they exclaimed, “Wow! That’s a Brahmā vehicle! It’s a vehicle fit for Brahmā!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding, “Sir, can you point out a Brahmā vehicle in this teaching and training?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I can, Ānanda,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“These are all terms for the noble eightfold path: ‘vehicle of Brahmā’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When right view is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion. When right thought … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right effort … right mindfulness … right immersion is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is a way to understand how these are all terms for the noble eightfold path: ‘vehicle of Brahmā’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Its qualities of faith and wisdom</p>
<p class="gatha">are always yoked to the shaft.</p>
<p class="gatha">Conscience is its pole, mind its strap,</p>
<p class="gatha">and mindfulness its careful driver.</p>
<p class="gatha0">The chariot’s equipped with ethics,</p>
<p class="gatha">its axle is absorption, and energy its wheel.</p>
<p class="gatha">Equanimity and immersion are the carriage-shaft,</p>
<p class="gatha">and it’s upholstered with desirelessness.</p>
<p class="gatha0">Good will, harmlessness, and seclusion</p>
<p class="gatha">are its weapons,</p>
<p class="gatha">patience its shield and armor,</p>
<p class="gatha">as it rolls on to sanctuary.</p>
<p class="gatha0">This supreme Brahmā vehicle</p>
<p class="gatha">arises in oneself.</p>
<p class="gatha">The wise leave the world in it,</p>
<p class="gatha">sure of winning the victory.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">5. What’s the Purpose</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha … and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, sometimes wanderers who follow other paths ask us: ‘Reverends, what’s the purpose of living the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama?’ We answer them like this: ‘The purpose of living the spiritual life under the Buddha is to completely understand suffering.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Answering this way, we trust that we repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. We trust our explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Indeed, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism. For the purpose of living the spiritual life with me is to completely understand suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If wanderers who follow other paths were to ask you: ‘Is there a path and a practice for completely understanding that suffering?’ You should answer them like this: ‘There is.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is that path? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is the path and the practice for completely understanding suffering. When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths, that’s how you should answer them.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and asked him, “Sir, they speak of this thing called the ‘spiritual path’. What is the spiritual path? And what is the culmination of the spiritual path?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicant, the spiritual path is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. The ending of greed, hate, and delusion. This is the culmination of the spiritual path.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, they speak of ‘the removal of greed, hate, and delusion’. What is this a term for?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicant, the removal of greed, hate, and delusion is a term for the natural principle of extinguishment. It’s used to speak of the ending of defilements.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the mendicant said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, they speak of ‘the deathless’. What is the deathless? And what is the path that leads to the deathless?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The ending of greed, hate, and delusion. This is called the deathless. The path that leads to the deathless is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">8. Analysis</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I will teach and analyze for you the noble eightfold path. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what is the noble eightfold path? It is right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is right view? Knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. This is called right view.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is right thought? It is the thought of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. This is called right thought.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is right speech? Avoiding speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. This is called right speech.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is right action? Avoiding killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual activity. This is called right action.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is right livelihood? It’s when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood. This is called right livelihood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is right effort? It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have not arisen do arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development. This is called right effort.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is right mindfulness? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. This is called right mindfulness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is right immersion? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called right immersion.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, suppose a spike of rice or barley was pointing the wrong way. If you trod on it with hand or foot, there’s no way it could break the skin and produce blood. Why is that? Because the spike is pointing the wrong way.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, a mendicant whose view and development of the path is pointing the wrong way cannot break ignorance, produce knowledge, and realize extinguishment. Why is that? Because their view is pointing the wrong way.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a spike of rice or barley was pointing the right way. If you trod on it with hand or foot, it may well break the skin and produce blood. Why is that? Because the spike is pointing the right way.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, how many things, when developed and cultivated, have extinguishment as their culmination, destination, and end?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“These eight things, when developed and cultivated, have extinguishment as their culmination, destination, and end. What eight? They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. These eight things, when developed and cultivated, have extinguishment as their culmination, destination, and end.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the wanderer Nandiya said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">How does a mendicant who develops the noble eightfold path disperse and still bad, unskillful qualities on the spot? It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That’s how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path disperses and stills bad, unskillful qualities on the spot.”</p>

Then in the cold season it was hauled up on dry land, where the ropes were weathered by wind and sun. When the clouds soaked it with rain, the ropes would readily collapse and rot away. In the same way, when a mendicant develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path their fetters readily collapse and rot away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how do they develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path so that their fetters readily collapse and rot away?

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, suppose there was a guest house. Lodgers come from the east, west, north, and south. Aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers all stay there. In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path completely understands by direct knowledge the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge. They give up by direct knowledge the things that should be given up by direct knowledge. They realize by direct knowledge the things that should be realized by direct knowledge. They develop by direct knowledge the things that should be developed by direct knowledge.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge? It should be said: the five grasping aggregates. What five? That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. These are the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge. And what are the things that should be given up by direct knowledge? Ignorance and craving for continued existence. These are the things that should be given up by direct knowledge. And what are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge? Knowledge and freedom. These are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge. And what are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge? Serenity and discernment. These are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, suppose that, although the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east, a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying: ‘We’ll make this Ganges river slant, slope, and incline to the west!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Would they succeed?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir. Why is that? The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west. That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, while a mendicant develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path, if rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying: ‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you? Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl? Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’ It’s simply impossible for a mendicant who develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path to reject the training and return to a lesser life. Why is that? Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant develop the noble eightfold path? It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.

Because after hearing the teaching of such mendicants, a mendicant will live withdrawn in both body and mind, as they recollect and think about that teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that teaching with wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles; they develop it and perfect it. As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy; they develop it and perfect it. When they’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it. When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it. When the body is tranquil and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion; they develop it and perfect it. They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated in this way they can expect seven fruits and benefits. What seven? They attain enlightenment early on in this very life. If not, they attain enlightenment at the time of death. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters, they’re extinguished between one life and the next. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished upon landing. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished without extra effort. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished with extra effort. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to the Akaniṭṭha realm. When the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated in this way these are the seven fruits and benefits they can expect.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">6. Kuṇḍaliya</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer part at the Añjana Wood. Then the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, I like to hang around the monasteries and visit the assemblies. When I’ve finished breakfast, it’s my habit to wander from monastery to monastery, from park to park. There I see some ascetics and brahmins speaking for the sake of winning debates and finding fault. But what benefit does Master Gotama live for?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The benefit the Realized One lives for, Kuṇḍaliya, is the fruit of knowledge and freedom.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill knowledge and freedom?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The seven awakening factors.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the seven awakening factors?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The four kinds of mindfulness meditation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The three kinds of good conduct.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sense restraint.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And Kuṇḍaliya, how is sense restraint developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct? A mendicant sees an agreeable sight with their eye. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. But if they see a disagreeable sight they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant hears an agreeable sound with the ear … smells an agreeable odor with the nose … tastes an agreeable flavor with the tongue … feels an agreeable touch with the body … knows an agreeable thought with their mind. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. But if they know a disagreeable thought they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a mendicant’s mind and body are steady internally, they’re well settled and well freed when it comes to both agreeable and disagreeable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. That’s how sense restraint is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how are the three kinds of good conduct developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? A mendicant gives up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develops good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. That’s how the three kinds of good conduct are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors? A mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom? A mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">30. With Udāyī</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. Then Venerable Udāyī went up to the Buddha … and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How helpful my love and respect for the Buddha have been, and my sense of conscience and prudence. For when I was still a layman, I wasn’t helped much by the teaching or the Saṅgha. But when I considered my love and respect for the Buddha, and my sense of conscience and prudence, I went forth from the lay life to homelessness. The Buddha taught me the Dhamma: ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, while staying in an empty hut, I followed the churning of the five grasping aggregates. I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. I comprehended the teaching; I acquired the path. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">I acquired the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, they will bring me to such a state that I will understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ This is the path that I acquired. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Udāyī! For that is indeed the path that you acquired. When developed and cultivated as you’re living in such a way, it will bring you to such a state that you will understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: ‘Mendicants, please give up the five hindrances—corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom—and truly develop the seven awakening factors.’ We too teach our disciples: ‘Reverends, please give up the five hindrances—corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom—and truly develop the seven awakening factors.’ What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">54. Full of Love</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town called Haliddavasana. Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Haliddavasana for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Haliddavasana. Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: ‘Come, mendicants, give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom, and meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">We too teach our disciples in just the same way. What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths. They got up from their seat, thinking:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” Then, after the meal, when they returned from alms-round, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them: ‘But reverends, how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? How is the heart’s release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? How is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? How is the heart’s release by equanimity developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?’ Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. Why is that?

<p class="bodytext">And how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by love together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. The apex of the heart’s release by love is the beautiful, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is the heart’s release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?

Or else, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. The apex of the heart’s release by compassion is the dimension of infinite space, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This is exactly how some foolish people ask me for something. But when the teaching has been explained they think only of following me around.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, may the Buddha teach me the Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities? Well purified ethics and correct view. When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What four?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Meditate observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Or meditate observing an aspect of the body externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Or meditate observing an aspect of the body internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Or meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally … externally … internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>

<p class="bodytext">And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>

And as the quail was being carried off he wailed, ‘I’m so unlucky, so unfortunate, to have roamed out of my territory into the domain of others. If today I’d roamed within my own territory, the domain of my fathers, this hawk wouldn’t have been able to beat me by fighting.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘So, quail, what is your own territory, the domain of your fathers?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘It’s a ploughed field covered with clods of earth.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She released the quail, saying, ‘Go now, quail. But even there you won’t escape me!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the quail went to a ploughed field covered with clods of earth. He climbed up a big clod, and standing there, he said to the hawk: ‘Come get me, hawk! Come get me, hawk!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She folded her wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail. When the quail knew that the hawk was nearly there, he slipped under that clod. But the hawk crashed chest-first right there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain of others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, mendicants, don’t roam out of your own territory into the domain of others. If you roam out of your own territory into the domain of others, Māra will find a vulnerability and get hold of you.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, in the Himalayas there are regions that are rugged and impassable. In some such regions, neither monkeys nor humans can go, while in others, monkeys can go but not humans. There are also level, pleasant places where both monkeys and humans can go. There hunters lay snares of tar on the monkey trails to catch the monkeys.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The monkeys who are not foolhardy and reckless see the tar and avoid it from afar. But a foolish and reckless monkey goes up to the tar and grabs it with a hand. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free his hand, he grabs it with his other hand. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free both hands, he grabs it with a foot. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free both hands and foot, he grabs it with his other foot. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free both hands and feet, he grabs it with his snout. He gets stuck there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so the monkey, trapped at five points, just lies there screeching. He’d meet with tragedy and disaster, and the hunter can do what he wants with him. The hunter spears him, pries him off that tarred block of wood, and goes wherever he wants.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">9. Sick</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the little village of Beluva. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī. I’ll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said, while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva.</p>
<p class="bodytext">After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. But he endured with mindfulness and situational awareness, without worrying. Then it occurred to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha. Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?” So that is what he did. Then the Buddha’s illness died down.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable, that he’s well, and that he’s alright. Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings didn’t spring to mind. Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that the Buddha won’t become fully extinguished without making some statement regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me now, Ānanda? I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings. The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If there’s anyone who thinks: ‘I’ll take charge of the Saṅgha of mendicants,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them make a statement regarding the Saṅgha. But the Realized One doesn’t think like this, so why should he make some statement regarding the Saṅgha?</p>
<p class="bodytext">I’m now old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. I’m currently eighty years old. Just as a decrepit cart keeps going by relying on straps, in the same way, the Realized One’s body keeps going by relying on straps, or so you’d think.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So Ānanda, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant do this? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">10. The Nuns’ Quarters</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the nuns’ quarters, and sat down on the seat spread out. Then several nuns went up to Venerable Ānanda bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, Ānanda, several nuns meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They have realized a higher distinction than they had before.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s how it is, sisters! That’s how it is, sisters! Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to realize a higher distinction than they had before.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Ānanda educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to realize a higher distinction than they had before.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, based on the body there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered. That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation. As they do so, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. Then they reflect: ‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. Let me now pull back.’ They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected. They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. As they meditate observing an aspect of principles, based on principles there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered. That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation. As they do so, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. Then they reflect: ‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. Let me now pull back.’ They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected. They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ That’s how there is directed development.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is there undirected development? Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ That’s how there is undirected development.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, Ānanda, I’ve taught you directed development and undirected development. Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples. Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">12. At Nālandā</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying: ‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that I have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present, what exactly are you doing, making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, though I don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present, still I understand this by inference from the teaching. Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out. He thinks, ‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: ‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Sāriputta! So Sāriputta, you should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Though there will be some foolish people who have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One, when they hear this exposition of the teaching they’ll give up that doubt or uncertainty.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. At that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying in the Magadhan lands near the little village of Nālaka, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. And the novice Cunda was his carer.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Sāriputta became fully extinguished because of that sickness. Then Cunda took Sāriputta’s bowl and robes and set out for Sāvatthī. He went to see Venerable Ānanda at Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished. This is his bowl and robe.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter. Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, this novice Cunda says that Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished. This is his bowl and robe. Since I heard this, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, and the teachings don’t spring to mind.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, Ānanda, when Sāriputta became fully extinguished, did he take away your entire spectrum of ethical conduct, of immersion, of wisdom, of freedom, or of the knowledge and vision of freedom?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir, he did not. But Venerable Sāriputta was my adviser and counselor. He educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired me. He never tired of teaching the Dhamma, and he supported his spiritual companions. I remember the nectar of the teaching, the riches of the teaching, the support of the teaching given by Venerable Sāriputta.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, did I not prepare for this when I explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart? That is not possible.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branch fell off. In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta has become fully extinguished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart? That is not possible.</p>

It was not long after Sāriputta and Moggallāna had become fully extinguished. Now, at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were silent. He addressed them:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, this assembly seems empty to me now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished. When Sāriputta and Moggallāna were alive, my assembly was never empty; I had no concern for any region where they stayed. The Buddhas of the past or the future have pairs of chief disciples who are no better than Sāriputta and Moggallāna were to me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s an incredible and amazing quality of such disciples that they fulfill the Teacher’s instructions and follow his advice. And they’re liked and approved, respected and admired by the four assemblies.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And it’s an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One that when such a pair of disciples becomes fully extinguished he does not sorrow or lament. How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart? That is not possible.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branch fell off. In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished.</p>

They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence.

That’s how, guarding and looking after ourselves, we’ll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s the way,” said the Buddha. “It’s just as Medakathālikā said to her teacher. Thinking ‘I’ll look after myself,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. Thinking ‘I’ll look after others,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. Looking after yourself, you look after others; and looking after others, you look after yourself.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, suppose that on hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land! The finest lady in the land!’ a large crowd would gather. And the finest lady in the land would dance and sing in a most thrilling way. On hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing! The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing!’ an even larger crowd would gather.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. They’d say to him, ‘Mister, this is a bowl full to the brim with oil. You must carry it in between this large crowd and the finest lady in the land. And a man with a drawn sword will follow behind you. Wherever you spill even a drop, he’ll chop off your head right there.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Would that person lose focus on that bowl, and negligently get distracted outside?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’ve made up this simile to make a point. And this is what it means. ‘A bowl of oil filled to the brim’ is a term for mindfulness of the body.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this: ‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’ That’s how you should train.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, at one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings … or mind … or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: ‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘The compassionate one, who sees the ending of rebirth,</p>
<p class="gatha">understands the path to convergence.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how the complexion of your skin is no longer pure and bright. Your limbs are flaccid and wrinkled, and your body is stooped. And it’s apparent that there has been a deterioration in your faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.”</p>

And it’s apparent that there has been a deterioration in the faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Curse this wretched old age,</p>
<p class="gatha">which makes you so ugly.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. What five? The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. What do these five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to? What experiences their scopes and ranges?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Brahmin, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. What five? The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. These five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to the mind. And the mind experiences their scopes and ranges.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“The mind has recourse to mindfulness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what does mindfulness have recourse to?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mindfulness has recourse to freedom.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what does freedom have recourse to?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Freedom has recourse to extinguishment.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what does extinguishment have recourse to?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This question goes too far, brahmin! You weren’t able to grasp the limit of questioning. For extinguishment is the culmination, destination, and end of the spiritual life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then the brahmin Uṇṇābha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Suppose there was a bungalow or a hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the eastern side. When the sun rises and a ray of light enters through a window, where would it land?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“On the western wall, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, the brahmin Uṇṇābha’s faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep. It’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. If he were to pass away at this time, he would be bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer part at the Añjana Wood. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, is there a way in which the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there is a way in which the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is that method? The faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith. The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy. The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion, and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion. The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose that there was a river slanting, sloping, and inclining to the east, and in the middle was an island. There’s a way in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream. But there’s also a way in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what’s the way in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream? By taking into account the water to the east and the west of the island, that river can be reckoned to have just one stream.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what’s the way in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams? By taking into account the water to the north and the south of the island, that river can be reckoned to have two streams.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, the faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith. The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy. The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion, and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion. The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s because of developing and cultivating the five faculties that a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”</p>

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, how many faculties must a mendicant develop and cultivate so that they can declare enlightenment: ‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town called Āpaṇa. Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sāriputta, would a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One have any doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One would have no doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You can expect that a faithful noble disciple will live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. For their energy is the faculty of energy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You can expect that a faithful and energetic noble disciple will be mindful, with utmost mindfulness and alertness, able to remember and recall what was said and done long ago. For their mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You can expect that a faithful, energetic, and mindful noble disciple will, relying on letting go, gain immersion, gain unification of mind. For their samādhi is the faculty of immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You can expect that a faithful, energetic, mindful noble disciple with their mind immersed in samādhi will understand this: ‘Transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. But when that dark mass of ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, that state is peaceful and sublime. That is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’ For their noble wisdom is the faculty of wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple has tried again and again, recollected again and again, entered immersion again and again, and understood with wisdom again and again, they will be confident of this: ‘I have previously heard of these things. But now I have direct meditative experience of them, and see them with penetrating wisdom.’ For their faith is the faculty of faith.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Sāriputta!</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sāriputta, a noble disciple who is sure and devoted to the Realized One would have no doubt or uncertainty about the Realized One or his instructions. …”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, is there a way that a mendicant who is a trainee, standing at the level of a trainee, can understand that they are a trainee? And that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee, standing at the level of a trainee, can understand that they are a trainee, and that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee? It’s when a mendicant who is a trainee truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. This is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant who is a trainee reflects: ‘Is there any other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true, as real, as accurate as that of the Buddha?’ They understand: ‘There is no other ascetic or brahmin elsewhere whose teaching is as true, as real, as accurate as that of the Buddha.’ This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant who is a trainee understands the five faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And although they don’t have direct meditative experience of their destination, apex, fruit, and culmination, they do see them with penetrating wisdom. This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept? It’s when a mendicant who is an adept understands the five faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.

This is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant who is an adept understands the six faculties: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. They understand: ‘These six faculties will totally and utterly cease without anything left over. And no other six faculties will arise anywhere anyhow.’ This too is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! When these five faculties are developed and cultivated they culminate, finish, and end in the deathless. What five?

<h3 class="subhead">10. At the Cāpāla Shrine</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, get your sitting cloth. Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out. Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time … and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to him, “Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their teacher’s doctrine, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Today you do have such monk disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Today you do have such nun disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples … and laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Today you do have such layman and laywoman disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual life is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ Today your spiritual life is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra, “Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So at the Cāpāla tree shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force. When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha was inspired to exclaim:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Weighing up the incomparable against an extension of life,</p>
<p class="gatha">the sage surrendered the life force.</p>
<p class="gatha">Happy inside, serene,</p>
<p class="gatha">he burst out of this self-made chain like a suit of armor.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason for the development of the bases of psychic power?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They think: “My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.” And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. They think: “My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.” And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. They understand mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … mind immersed in samādhi … mind not immersed in samādhi … freed mind … They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, if a mendicant depends on enthusiasm in order to gain immersion, gain unification of mind, this is called immersion due to enthusiasm.

<h3 class="subhead">14. With Moggallāna</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. Now at that time several mendicants were staying beneath the longhouse. They were restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, “These spiritual companions of yours staying beneath the longhouse are restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with wandering mind and undisciplined faculties. Go, Moggallāna, and strike awe in those mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Mahāmoggallāna. Then he used his psychic power to make the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe. Then those mendicants stood to one side, shocked and awestruck.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Why do you, mendicants, stand to one side, shocked and awestruck?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Wanting to strike awe in you, the mendicant Moggallāna made the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? What things has the mendicant Moggallāna developed and cultivated so as to have such power and might?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicants, listen. The mendicant Moggallāna has become so powerful and mighty by developing and cultivating the four bases of psychic power. What four? Moggallāna develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm … energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. He thinks: ‘My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ And he meditates perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.

<h3 class="subhead">15. The Brahmin Uṇṇābha</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, “Master Ānanda, what’s the purpose of living the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The purpose of living the spiritual life under the Buddha, brahmin, is to give up desire.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But is there a path and a practice for giving up that desire?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is that path?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm … energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. This is the path and the practice for giving up that desire.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This being the case, Master Ānanda, the path is endless, not finite. For it’s not possible to give up desire by means of desire.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, brahmin? Have you ever had a desire to walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding desire faded away?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Have you ever had the energy to walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding energy faded away?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Have you ever had the idea to walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding idea faded away?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Have you ever inquired regarding a walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding inquiry faded away?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, take a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment. They formerly had the desire to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding desire faded away. They formerly had the energy to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding energy faded away. They formerly had the idea to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding idea faded away. They formerly inquired regarding attaining perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding inquiry faded away. What do you think, brahmin? This being the case, is the path endless or finite?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Clearly, Master Ānanda, this being the case, the path is finite, not endless. Excellent, Master Ānanda! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when the four bases of psychic power are developed and cultivated they’re very fruitful and beneficial.</p>
<p class="bodytext">How so? It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They think: ‘My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. They think: ‘My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense.

And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is enthusiasm that’s too lax? It’s when enthusiasm is combined with laziness. This is called lax enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is enthusiasm that’s too tense? It’s when enthusiasm is combined with restlessness. This is called tense enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is enthusiasm that’s constricted internally? It’s when enthusiasm is combined with dullness and drowsiness. This is called enthusiasm constricted internally.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is enthusiasm that’s distracted externally? It’s when enthusiasm is frequently distracted and diffused externally on account of the five kinds of sensual stimulation. This is called enthusiasm distracted externally.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before? It’s when the perception of continuity is properly grasped, attended, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant. That’s how a mendicant meditates perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant meditate as below, so above; as above, so below? It’s when a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ That’s how a mendicant meditates as below, so above; as above, so below.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant meditate as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day? It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort, with the same features, attributes, and signs by day as by night. And they develop it with the same features, attributes, and signs by night as by day. That’s how a mendicant meditates as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how, with an open and unenveloped heart, does a mendicant develop a mind that’s full of radiance? It’s when a mendicant has properly grasped the perception of light, and has properly grasped the perception of day.

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then as Anuruddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Whoever has missed out on these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has missed out on the noble path to the complete ending of suffering. Whoever has undertaken these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has undertaken the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna knew what Venerable Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he reappeared in front of Anuruddha, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Anuruddha, how do you define the undertaking of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation by a mendicant?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, it’s when a mendicant meditates observing the body internally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing the body externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing the body internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They meditate observing feelings internally … externally … internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish …</p>
<p class="bodytext">They meditate observing the mind internally … externally … internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish …</p>
<p class="bodytext">They meditate observing principles internally … externally … internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish …</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut. There Venerable Anuruddha addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, suppose that, although the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east, a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying: ‘We’ll make this Ganges river slant, slope, and incline to the west!’ What do you think, reverends? Would they succeed?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend. Why is that? The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west. That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, while a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, if rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying: ‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you? Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl? Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s simply impossible for a mendicant who is developing and cultivating the four kinds of mindfulness meditation to reject the training and return to a lesser life. Why is that? Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">There the Buddha … said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, do you develop mindfulness of breathing?” When he said this, Venerable Ariṭṭha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I develop mindfulness of breathing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I’ve given up desire for sensual pleasures of the past. I’m rid of desire for sensual pleasures of the future. And I have eliminated perception of repulsion regarding phenomena internally and externally. Just mindful, I will breathe in. Mindful, I will breathe out. That’s how I develop mindfulness of breathing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That is mindfulness of breathing, Ariṭṭha; I don’t deny it. But as to how mindfulness of breathing is fulfilled in detail, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Ariṭṭha replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And how is mindfulness of breathing fulfilled in detail? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut. They sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.

<p class="bodytext">Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too usually practiced this kind of meditation.

<p class="bodytext">When mindfulness of breathing has been developed and cultivated in this way, if they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.

<p class="bodytext">If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached.

<p class="bodytext">Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel.

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time the Buddha spoke in many ways to the mendicants about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for a fortnight. No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my alms-food.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the alms-food.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those mendicants thought, “The Buddha spoke in many ways about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development.” They committed themselves to developing the many different facets of the meditation on ugliness. Becoming horrified, repelled, and disgusted with this body, they looked for someone to slit their wrists. Each day ten, twenty, or thirty mendicants slit their wrists.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then after a fortnight had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda, “Ānanda, why does the mendicant Saṅgha seem so diminished?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ānanda told the Buddha all that had happened, and said, “Sir, please explain another way for the mendicant Saṅgha to get enlightened.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Vesālī together in the assembly hall.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked, went up to him, and said, “Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, come at your convenience.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the last month of summer, when the dust and dirt is stirred up, a large sudden storm disperses and settles it on the spot.</p>

It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ … They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a mendicant is breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ … They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Why is that? Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture … bliss … mind …’ … They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the mental processes.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Why is that? Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind … immersing the mind in samādhi … freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Why is that? Because there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence … fading away … cessation … letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Having seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion, they watch closely over with equanimity. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors? Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body, their mindfulness is established and lucid. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that principle with wisdom. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles; they develop it and perfect it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy; they develop it and perfect it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the body is tranquil and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion; they develop it and perfect it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles, their mindfulness is established and lucid. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">(This should be told in full as for the first kind of mindfulness meditation.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it. That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom? It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">1. A Wheel-Turning Monarch</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There the Buddha … said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, suppose a wheel-turning monarch were to rule as sovereign lord over these four continents. And when his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. There he entertains himself in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. Still, as he’s lacking four things, he’s not exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. He’s not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now suppose a noble disciple wears rags and feeds on scraps of alms-food. Still, as they have four things, they’re exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What four? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And, mendicants, gaining these four continents is not worth a sixteenth part of gaining these four things.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What four? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. A noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Those who have faith and ethics,</p>

<h3 class="subhead">3. With Dīghāvu</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the lay follower Dhīgāvu was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed his father, the householder Jotika, “Please, householder, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the lay follower Dhīgāvu is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, dear,” replied Jotika. He did as Dīghāvu asked. The Buddha consented in silence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the lay follower Dīghāvu, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to him, “I hope you’re coping, Dīghāvu; I hope you’re getting better. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So, Dīghāvu, you should train like this: ‘I will have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And I will have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ That’s how you should train.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I am seen in them. For I have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And I have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In that case, Dīghāvu, grounded on these four factors of stream-entry you should further develop these six things that play a part in realization. You should meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation. That’s how you should train.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“These six things that play a part in realization that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I embody them. For I meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But still, sir, I think, ‘I hope Jotika doesn’t suffer grief when I’ve gone.’” Jotika said, “Dear Dīghāvu, don’t focus on that. Come on, dear Dīghāvu, you should closely focus on what the Buddha is saying.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the Buddha had given this advice he got up from his seat and left. Not long after the Buddha left, Dīghāvu passed away. Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, the lay follower named Dīghāvu, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away. Where has he been reborn in his next life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, the lay follower Dīghāvu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings. With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously, and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. Now at that time the chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa were residing in Sādhuka on some business. They heard about this.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So they posted someone on the road, saying:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“My good man, let us know when you see the Blessed One coming, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.” And that person stood there for two or three days before they saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. When they saw him, they went to the chamberlains and said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sirs, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is coming. Please come at your convenience.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the chamberlains went up to the Buddha, bowed, and followed behind him. And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a tree, and sat down on the seat spread out. The chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, when we hear that you will be setting out from Sāvatthī to wander in the Kosalan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that you will be far from us. And when we hear that you are setting out from Sāvatthī to wander in the Kosalan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that you are far from us.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Well then, chamberlains, living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. Just this much is enough to be diligent.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, for us there is something that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is that?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, it’s when King Pasenadi of Kosala wants to go and visit a park. We have to harness and prepare his royal elephants. Then we have to seat his dear and beloved wives on the elephants, one in front of us, and one behind. Those sisters smell like a freshly opened perfume box; that’s how the royal ladies smell with makeup on. The touch of those sisters is like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok; that’s how dainty the royal ladies are. Now at that time we must look after the elephants, the sisters, and ourselves. But we don’t recall having a bad thought regarding those sisters. This is that thing that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, chamberlains, living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. Just this much is enough to be diligent. A noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">7. The People of Bamboo Gate</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Bamboo Gate. The brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Bamboo Gate, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes. We wish to live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from Kāsi; to wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and to accept gold and money. And when our body breaks up, after death, we wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. Given that we have such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householders, I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that’s relevant to oneself. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what is the explanation of the Dhamma that’s relevant to oneself?</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ‘I want to live and don’t want to die; I want to be happy and recoil from pain. Since this is so, if someone were to take my life, I wouldn’t like that. But others also want to live and don’t want to die; they want to be happy and recoil from pain. So if I were to take the life of someone else, they wouldn’t like that either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up killing living creatures themselves. And they encourage others to give up killing living creatures, praising the giving up of killing living creatures. So their bodily behavior is purified in three points.</p>

I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! … We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, the monk named Sāḷha has passed away. Where has he been reborn in his next life? The nun named Nandā, the layman named Sudatta, and the laywoman named Sujātā have passed away. Where have they been reborn in the next life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, the monk Sāḷha passed away having realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The nun Nandā passed away having ended the five lower fetters. She’s been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The layman Sudatta passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. He’s a once-returner; he will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The laywoman Sujātā passed away having ended three fetters. She’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away. But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone dies that would be a bother for me. So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī “Mendicants, the brahmins advocate a practice called ‘get up and go’. They encourage their disciples: ‘Please, good people, rising early you should face east and walk. Do not avoid a pit, a cliff, a stump, thorny ground, a swamp, or a sewer. You should await death in the place that you fall. And when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a good place, a heaven realm.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">But this practice of the brahmins is a foolish procedure, a stupid procedure. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, or extinguishment. But in the training of the noble one I advocate a ‘get up and go’ practice which does lead solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.</p>

Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, how many things do people have to give up and how many do they have to possess in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, people have to give up four things and possess four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What four? They don’t have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And they do have the experiential confidence in the Buddha that causes an educated noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t have the distrust in the teaching that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

<p class="bodytext">They don’t have the distrust in the Saṅgha that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, and worthy of veneration with joined palms.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t have the unethical conduct that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And they do have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones that causes an educated noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. Their ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.

<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed a man, “Please, mister, go to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Anāthapiṇḍika asked. Sāriputta consented in silence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to Anāthapiṇḍika’s home. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika, “Householder, I hope you’re coping; I hope you’re getting better. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, you don’t have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

<p class="bodytext">You don’t have the distrust in the teaching that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

<p class="bodytext">You don’t have the distrust in the Saṅgha that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And you have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, and worthy of veneration with joined palms. It is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence in the Saṅgha, that pain may die down on the spot.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You don’t have the unethical conduct that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

<p class="bodytext">You don’t have the wrong view that causes an uneducated ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. You have right view. Seeing in yourself that right view, that pain may die down on the spot.</p>

<p class="bodytext">And then Anāthapiṇḍika’s pain died down on the spot. Then he served Sāriputta and Ānanda from his own dish. When Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Anāthapiṇḍika took a low seat and sat to one side. Venerable Sāriputta expressed his appreciation to him with these verses.</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Whoever has faith in the Realized One,</p>
<p class="gatha">unwavering and well grounded;</p>

<h3 class="subhead">28. Dangers and Threats (1st)</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures. Anyone who steals … Anyone who commits sexual misconduct … Anyone who lies … Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom? A noble disciple properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.' That is: Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm.

<p class="bodytext">“And how does a noble disciple live negligently? Firstly, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … They’re content with that confidence, and don’t make a further effort for solitude by day or retreat by night. When they live negligently, there’s no joy. When there’s no joy, there’s no rapture. When there’s no rapture, there’s no tranquility. When there’s no tranquility, there’s suffering. When one is suffering, the mind does not become immersed in samādhi. When the mind is not immersed in samādhi, principles do not become clear. Because principles have not become clear, they’re reckoned to live negligently.</p>

<p class="bodytext">And how does a noble disciple live diligently? Firstly, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … But they’re not content with that confidence, and make a further effort for solitude by day and retreat by night. When they live diligently, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. When the mind is immersed in samādhi, principles become clear. Because principles have become clear, they’re reckoned to live diligently.</p>

<p class="bodytext">If they reply, ‘I have given up concern for my partners and children,’ they should say: ‘But are you concerned for the five kinds of human sensual stimulation?’ If they reply, ‘I am,’ they should say: ‘Good sir, heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual pleasures. It would be good to turn your mind away from human sensual pleasures and fix it on the gods of the Four Great Kings.’</p>

It would be good to turn your mind away from the Brahmā realm and apply it to the cessation of identity.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">If they reply, ‘I have done so,’ then there is no difference between a lay follower whose mind is freed in this way and a mendicant whose mind is freed from defilements; that is, between the freedom of one and the other.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">11. Rolling Forth the Wheel of Dhamma</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, these two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth. What two? Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is that middle way? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is that middle way, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now this is the noble truth of suffering. Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering. It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure in various different realms. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now this is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This is the noble truth of suffering.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. ‘This noble truth of suffering should be completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of suffering has been completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering should be given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering should be realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me …</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering should be developed.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been developed.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As long as my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was not fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve respects, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But when my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve respects, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there are no more future lives.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the group of five mendicants was happy with what the Buddha said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Venerable Koṇḍañña: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And when the Buddha rolled forth the Wheel of Dhamma, the earth gods raised the cry: “Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings … the Gods of the Thirty-Three … the Gods of Yama … the Joyful Gods … the Gods Who Love to Create … the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … the Gods of Brahmā’s Host raised the cry: “Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so at that moment, in that instant, the cry soared up to the Brahmā realm. And this galaxy shook and rocked and trembled. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appeared in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha was inspired to exclaim: “Koṇḍañña has really understood! Koṇḍañña has really understood!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And that’s how Venerable Koṇḍañña came to be known as “Koṇḍañña Who Understood”.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis at the village of Koṭi. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, not understanding and not penetrating four noble truths, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What four? The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. These noble truths of suffering, origin, cessation, and the path have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the attachment to continued existence is ended; now there are no more future lives.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Because of not truly seeing</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain person left Rājagaha, thinking ‘I’ll speculate about the world.’ They went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. Then that person saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. When he saw this he thought, ‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that person entered the city and informed a large crowd, ‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘But how is it that you’re mad? How have you lost your mind? And what have you seen that doesn’t exist in the world?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Sirs, I left Rājagaha, thinking “I’ll speculate about the world.” I went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world.

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. He saw several Licchavi youths practicing archery. They were shooting arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he saw this he thought, “These Licchavi youths really are trained, so well trained, in that they shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Ānanda? Which is harder and more challenging: to shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing? Or to take a horsehair split into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s more difficult and challenging, sir, to take a horsehair split into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip.”</p>
