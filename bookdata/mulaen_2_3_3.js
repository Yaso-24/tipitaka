<h3 class="subhead">1. Nakula’s Father</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the householder Nakula’s father went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I’m an old man, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. My body is ailing and I’m constantly unwell. I hardly ever get to see the esteemed mendicants. May the Buddha please advise me, and instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder! For this body is ailing, trapped in its shell. If anyone dragging around this body claimed to be healthy even for a minute, what’s that but foolishness?</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this: ‘Though my body is ailing, my mind will be healthy.’ That’s how you should train.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then the householder Nakula’s father approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. Did you get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Buddha’s presence today?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What else, sir, could it possibly be? Just now the Buddha anointed me with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what kind of ambrosial Dhamma talk has the Buddha anointed you with?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So Nakula’s father told Sāriputta all that had happened, and said, “That’s the ambrosial Dhamma talk that the Buddha anointed me with.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But didn’t you feel the need to ask the Buddha the further question: ‘Sir, how do you define someone ailing in body and ailing in mind, and someone ailing in body and healthy in mind’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, householder, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Nakula’s father. Sāriputta said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And how is a person ailing in body and ailing in mind? It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a noble one. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a good person. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am form, form is mine!’ But that form of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am feeling, feeling is mine!’ But that feeling of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am perception, perception is mine!’ But that perception of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am choices, choices are mine!’ But those choices of theirs decay and perish, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am consciousness, consciousness is mine!’ But that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how a person is ailing in body and ailing in mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is a person ailing in body and healthy in mind? It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am form, form is mine!’ So when that form of theirs decays and perishes, it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling. They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am feeling, feeling is mine!’ So when that feeling of theirs decays and perishes, it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.</p>

<p class="bodytext">That’s how a person is ailing in body and healthy in mind.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s what Venerable Sāriputta said. Satisfied, Nakula’s father was happy with what Sāriputta said.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">2. At Devadaha</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Devadaha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several mendicants who were heading for the west went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicants, have you consulted with Sāriputta?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir, we haven’t.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You should consult with Sāriputta. He’s astute, and supports his spiritual companions, the mendicants.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was meditating not far from the Buddha in a clump of golden shower trees. And then those mendicants approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there. We have consulted with the Teacher.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—for astute people are inquisitive: ‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ I trust the venerables have properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered the teachings, and penetrated them with wisdom. That way, when answering you will repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth. You will explain in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—for astute people are inquisitive: ‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘Reverend, our Teacher explained the removal of desire and lust.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further: ‘But regarding what does the venerables’ teacher explain the removal of desire and lust?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘Our teacher explains the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further: ‘But what drawback has he seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘If you’re not free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes it gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. If you’re not free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes it gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. This is the drawback our Teacher has seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further: ‘But what benefit has he seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. This is the benefit our Teacher has seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">If those who acquired and kept unskillful qualities were to live happily in the present life, free of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a good place, the Buddha would not praise giving up unskillful qualities. But since those who acquire and keep unskillful qualities live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and since, when their body breaks up, after death, they can expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha praises giving up unskillful qualities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If those who embraced and kept skillful qualities were to live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha would not praise embracing skillful qualities. But since those who embrace and keep skillful qualities live happily in the present life, free of anguish, distress, and fever; and since, when their body breaks up, after death, they can expect to go to a good place, the Buddha praises embracing skillful qualities.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is what Venerable Sāriputta said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">3. With Hāliddikāni</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the householder Hāliddikāni went up to Venerable Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, this was said by the Buddha in the Chapter of the Eights, in ‘The Questions of Māgandiya’:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘After leaving shelter to become an unsettled migrant,</p>
<p class="gatha">a sage doesn’t get close to anyone in town.</p>
<p class="gatha">Rid of sensual pleasures, expecting nothing,</p>
<p class="gatha">they don’t argue with anyone.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">How should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, the form element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is shackled to greed for the form element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter. The feeling element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is attached to greed for the feeling element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter. The perception element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is attached to greed for the perception element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter. The choices element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is attached to greed for the choices element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter. That’s how one is a migrant going from shelter to shelter.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is one a migrant without a shelter? The Realized One has given up any desire, greed, relishing, and craving for the form element; any attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendencies. He has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s why the Realized One is called a migrant without a shelter. The Realized One has given up any desire, greed, relishing, and craving for the feeling element … the perception element … the choices element … the consciousness element; any attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendencies. He has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s why the Realized One is called a migrant without a shelter. That’s how one is a migrant without a shelter.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is one a migrant going from settlement to settlement? Being attached to migrating from settlement to settlement in pursuit of sights, one is called a migrant going from settlement to settlement. Being attached to migrating from settlement to settlement in pursuit of sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts, one is called a migrant going from settlement to settlement. That’s how one is a migrant going from settlement to settlement.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is one an unsettled migrant? The Realized One has given up attachment to migrating from settlement to settlement in pursuit of sights.

That’s how one is an unsettled migrant.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does one get close to people in town? It’s when someone mixes closely with laypeople, sharing their joys and sorrows—happy when they’re happy and sad when they’re sad—and getting involved in their business. That’s how one gets close to people in town.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does one not get close to people in town? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t mix closely with laypeople, not sharing their joys and sorrows—not happy when they’re happy or sad when they’re sad—and not getting involved in their business. That’s how one doesn’t get close to people in town.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is one not rid of sensual pleasures? It’s when someone isn’t rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures. That’s how one is not rid of sensual pleasures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is one rid of sensual pleasures? It’s when someone is rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures. That’s how one is rid of sensual pleasures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does one have expectations? It’s when someone thinks: ‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, and such consciousness!’ That’s how one has expectations.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does one expect nothing? It’s when someone doesn’t think: ‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, and such consciousness!’ That’s how one expects nothing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does one argue with people? It’s when someone takes part in this sort of discussion: ‘You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. I stay on topic, you don’t. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!’ That’s how one argues with people.</p>

<p class="bodytext">So, householder, that’s how to understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief in the Chapter of the Eights, in ‘The Questions of Māgandiya’:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘After leaving shelter to become an unsettled migrant,</p>
<p class="gatha">a sage doesn’t get close to anyone in town.</p>

<p class="bodytext">What do they approve, welcome, and keep clinging to? They approve, welcome, and keep clinging to form. This gives rise to relishing. Relishing forms is grasping.

As long as they’re not rid of the conceit ‘I am’, the five faculties are conceived—the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. The mind, thoughts, and the element of ignorance are all present. Struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, an uneducated ordinary person thinks ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will not be percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient’.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">55. An Inspired Saying</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There the Buddha was inspired to exclaim: “‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine.’ A mendicant who makes such a resolution can cut off the five lower fetters.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, “But sir, how can a mendicant who makes such a resolution cut off the five lower fetters?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicant, take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in their teaching. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in their teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t truly understand form—which is impermanent—as impermanent. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is impermanent—as impermanent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t truly understand form—which is suffering—as suffering. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is suffering—as suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t truly understand form—which is not-self—as not-self. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is not-self—as not-self.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t truly understand form—which is conditioned—as conditioned. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is conditioned—as conditioned.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t truly understand that form will disappear. They don’t truly understand that feeling … perception … choices … consciousness will disappear.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self … They don’t regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They truly understand form—which is impermanent—as impermanent. They truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is impermanent—as impermanent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They truly understand form … feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is suffering—as suffering.</p>

<p class="bodytext">They truly understand form … feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is conditioned—as conditioned.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They truly understand that form will disappear. They truly understand that feeling … perception … choices … consciousness will disappear.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s because of the disappearance of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that a mendicant who makes such a resolution—‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine’—can cut off the five lower fetters.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, a mendicant who makes such a resolution can cut off the five lower fetters.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But how are they to know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicant, an uneducated ordinary person worries about things that aren’t a worry. For an uneducated ordinary person worries: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">An educated noble disciple doesn’t worry about things that aren’t a worry. For an educated noble disciple doesn’t worry: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">As long as consciousness remains, it would remain involved with form, supported by form, founded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Or consciousness would remain involved with feeling …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Or consciousness would remain involved with perception …</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, form is not-self. For if form were self, it wouldn’t lead to affliction. And you could compel form: ‘May my form be like this!

<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When you grasp, mendicant, you’re bound by Māra. Not grasping, you’re free from the Wicked One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Holy One!”</p>

<p class="bodytext">That’s how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">This is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And that mendicant became one of the perfected.</p>

Then he sets out on the hunt. And the animals who hear the roar of the lion, king of beasts, are typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. They return to their lairs, be they in a hole, the water, or a wood; and the birds take to the air. Even the royal elephants, bound with strong harness in the villages, towns, and capital cities, break apart their bonds, and urinate and defecate in terror as they flee here and there. That’s how powerful is the lion, king of beasts, among animals, how illustrious and mighty.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when a Realized One arises in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed—he teaches the Dhamma: ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, there are gods who are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy, living for ages in their divine palaces. When they hear this teaching by the Realized One, they’re typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. ‘Oh no! It turns out we’re impermanent, though we thought we were permanent! It turns out we don’t last, though we thought we were everlasting! It turns out we’re short-lived, though we thought we were eternal! It turns out that we’re impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, and included within identity.’ That’s how powerful is the Realized One in the world with its gods, how illustrious and mighty.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>

Form is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into form. Feeling is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into feeling. Perception is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into perception. Choices are conditioned phenomena; choices are what make them into choices. Consciousness is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into consciousness. Choices produce conditioned phenomena; that’s why they’re called ‘choices’.</p>

<p class="bodytext">A noble disciple reflects on this: ‘Currently I’m itched by form. In the past I was also itched by form just like now. If I were to look forward to enjoying form in the future, I’d be itched by form in the future just as I am today.’ Reflecting like this they don’t worry about past form, they don’t look forward to enjoying future form, and they practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding present form.</p>

<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is called a noble disciple who gets rid of things and doesn’t accumulate them; who gives things up and doesn’t grasp at them; who discards things and doesn’t amass them; who dissipates things and doesn’t get clouded by them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what things do they get rid of and not accumulate? They get rid of form and don’t accumulate it. They get rid of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness and don’t accumulate it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what things do they give up and not grasp? They give up form and don’t grasp it. They give up feeling … perception … choices … consciousness and don’t grasp it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what things do they discard and not amass? They discard form and don’t amass it. They discard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness and don’t amass it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what things do they dissipate and not get clouded by? They dissipate form and don’t get clouded by it. They dissipate feeling … perception … choices … consciousness and don’t get clouded by it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is called a mendicant who neither gets rid of things nor accumulates them, but remains after getting rid of them. They neither give things up nor grasp them, but remain after giving them up. They neither discard things nor amass them, but remain after discarding them. They neither dissipate things nor get clouded by them, but remain after dissipating them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what things do they neither get rid of nor accumulate, but remain after getting rid of them? They neither get rid of nor accumulate form, but remain after getting rid of it.

<p class="bodytext">When a mendicant’s mind is freed like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and Pajāpati worship them from afar:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred!</p>

<h3 class="subhead">80. Beggars</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha, having dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha for some reason, robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms. He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Great Wood, plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the day’s meditation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “I’ve sent the mendicant Saṅgha away. But there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. Not seeing me they may change and fall apart. If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart. … Or if young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart. In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. Not seeing me they may change and fall apart. Why don’t I support the mendicant Saṅgha now as I did in the past?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! The Buddha has sent the mendicant Saṅgha away. But there are mendicants who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. … May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha! May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha! May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha consented in silence. Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that the Buddha had consented, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then he used his psychic power to will that the mendicants would come to him timidly, alone or in pairs. Those mendicants approached the Buddha timidly, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, this relying on alms is an extreme way to live. The world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’ Yet earnest and gentlemen take it up for a good reason. Not because they’ve been forced to by kings or bandits, or because they’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living. But because they’re swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. And they think, ‘Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how this gentleman has gone forth. Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and hateful intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness. I say that person is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are these three unskillful thoughts. Sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. And where do these three unskillful thoughts cease without anything left over? In those who meditate with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation; or who develop signless immersion. Just this much is quite enough motivation to develop signless immersion. When signless immersion is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are these two views. Views favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence. A noble disciple reflects on this: ‘Is there anything in the world that I could grasp without fault?’ They understand: ‘There’s nothing in the world that I could grasp without fault. For in grasping I would grasp only at form, feeling, perception, choices, or consciousness. That grasping of mine would be a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So you should truly see …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">81. At Pārileyya</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambi for alms. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone, with no companion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, not long after the Buddha had left, one of the mendicants went to Venerable Ānanda and told him what had happened. Ānanda said, “Reverend, when the Buddha leaves like this it means he wants to stay alone. At this time no-one should follow him.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage, arrived at Pārileyya, where he stayed at the root of a sacred sal tree. Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha. We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda together with those mendicants went to Pārileyya to see the Buddha. They bowed and sat down to one side, and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time one of the monks had the thought, “How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically. I’ve analytically taught the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. That’s how I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically. Though I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically, still a certain mendicant present here has this thought: ‘How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how, mendicants, do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life? Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They regard form as self. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source, origin, birthplace, and root of that conditioned phenomenon? When an uneducated ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That conditioned phenomenon is born from that. So that conditioned phenomenon is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Perhaps they don’t regard form as self, but they still regard self as possessing form. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. …</p>

<h3 class="subhead">82. A Full Moon Night</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied that mendicant. He took his seat and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates, that is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.” … “But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Neither. Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There can,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s when someone thinks: ‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, or such consciousness!’ That’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form. Any kind of feeling at all … Any kind of perception at all … Any kind of choices at all … Any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness. That’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found? What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness is found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The four primary elements are the reason why the aggregate of form is found. Contact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling, perception, and choices are found. Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, how does identity view come about?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s because an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how identity view comes about.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, how does identity view not come about?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s because an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They don’t regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how identity view does not come about.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification. That form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. Removing and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape. The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling … perception … choices … consciousness: this is its gratification. That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“One truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ That’s how to know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s possible that some foolish person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think: ‘So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?’ Now, mendicants, you have been educated by me in questioning with regards to all these things in all such cases.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Two on the aggregates; exactly the same; and can there be;</p>
<p class="gatha">on the term; and on the cause;</p>
<p class="gatha">two questions on identity;</p>
<p class="gatha">gratification; and that with consciousness:</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Reverend,” they replied. Ānanda said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, the venerable named Puṇṇa Mantāniputta was very helpful to me when I was just ordained. He gave me this advice: ‘Reverend Ānanda, the notion “I am” occurs because of grasping, not by not grasping. Grasping what?

<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water.

<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Tissa, the Buddha’s paternal cousin, informed several mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t inspire me, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I live the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the Buddha said to a certain monk, “Please, mendicant, in my name tell the mendicant Tissa that the Teacher summons him.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Tissa and said to him, “Reverend Tissa, the teacher summons you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” Tissa replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is it really true, Tissa, that you informed several mendicants that your body feels like it’s drugged … and you have doubts about the teachings?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Tissa? If you’re not rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Tissa! That’s how it is, Tissa, when you’re not rid of greed for form.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you’re not rid of greed for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Tissa! That’s how it is, Tissa, when you’re not rid of greed for consciousness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Tissa? If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Tissa! That’s how it is, Tissa, when you are rid of greed for form … feeling … perception … choices … consciousness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Tissa? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose, Tissa, there were two people. One was not skilled in the path, the other was. The one not skilled in the path would question the one skilled in the path, who would reply: ‘Come, good man, this is the path. Go down it a little, and you’ll see a fork in the road. Ignore the left, and take the right-hand path. Go a little further, and you’ll see a dark forest grove. Go a little further, and you’ll see an expanse of low-lying marshes. Go a little further, and you’ll see a large, steep cliff. Go a little further, and you’ll see level, cleared parkland.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">I’ve made up this simile to make a point. And this is what it means.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘A person who is not skilled in the path’ is a term for an ordinary uneducated person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘A person who is skilled in the path’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘A fork in the road’ is a term for doubt.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘The left-hand path’ is a term for the wrong eightfold path, that is, wrong view … wrong immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘The right-hand path’ is a term for the noble eightfold path, that is, right view … right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘A dark forest grove’ is a term for ignorance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘An expanse of low-lying marshes’ is a term for sensual pleasures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘A large, steep cliff’ is a term for anger and distress.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Level, cleared parkland’ is a term for extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Rejoice, Tissa, rejoice! I’m here to advise you, to support you, and to teach you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Tissa was happy with what the Buddha said.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">85. With Yamaka</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time a mendicant called Yamaka had the following harmful misconception: “As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Several mendicants heard about this. They went to Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverends, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Don’t say that, Yamaka! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.” But even though admonished by those mendicants, Yamaka obstinately stuck to that misconception and insisted on stating it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When those mendicants were unable to dissuade Yamaka from that misconception, they got up from their seats and went to see Venerable Sāriputta. They told him what had happened, and said, “May Venerable Sāriputta please go to the mendicant Yamaka out of compassion.” Sāriputta consented in silence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him. Seated to one side he said to Yamaka:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Yamaka? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Reverend Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as form?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you regard the Realized One as feeling … perception … choices … consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Reverend Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as in form?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling … or distinct from feeling … as in perception … or distinct from perception … as in choices … or distinct from choices … as in consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In that case, Reverend Yamaka, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Sāriputta, in my ignorance, I used to have that misconception. But now that I’ve heard the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta I’ve given up that misconception, and I’ve comprehended the teaching.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Yamaka, suppose they were to ask you: ‘When their body breaks up, after death, what happens to a perfected one, who has ended the defilements?’ How would you answer?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, if they were to ask this, I’d answer like this: ‘Reverend, form is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering has ceased and ended.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Feeling … perception … choices … consciousness is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering has ceased and ended.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Reverend Yamaka! Well then, I shall give you a simile to make the meaning even clearer. Suppose there was a householder or householder’s son who was rich, with a lot of money and great wealth, and a bodyguard for protection. Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten him, and take his life. They’d think: ‘This householder or householder’s son is rich, with a lot of money and great wealth, and a bodyguard for protection. It won’t be easy to take his life by force. Why don’t I get close to him, then take his life?’ So he goes up to that householder or householder’s son and says: ‘Sir, I would serve you.’ Then they would serve that householder or householder’s son. They’d get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely. The householder or householder’s son would consider them as a friend and companion, and come to trust them. But when that person realizes that they’ve gained the trust of the householder or householder’s son, then, when they know he’s alone, they’d take his life with a sharp knife.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Yamaka? When that person went to the householder or householder’s son and offered to serve him, weren’t they a killer then, though he didn’t know that this was his killer? And when they got up before him and went to bed after him, being obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, weren’t they a killer then, though he didn’t know that this was his killer? And when, knowing he was alone, they took his life with a sharp knife, weren’t they a killer then, though he didn’t know that this was his killer?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t truly understand form—which is impermanent—as impermanent. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is impermanent—as impermanent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t truly understand form—which is suffering—as suffering. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is suffering—as suffering.</p>

<p class="bodytext">They don’t truly understand form—which is a killer—as a killer. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is a killer—as a killer.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re attracted to form, grasp it, and commit to the notion that it is ‘my self’. They’re attracted to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, grasp it, and commit to the notion that it is ‘my self’. And when you’ve gotten involved with and grasped these five grasping aggregates, they lead to your lasting harm and suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">An educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They don’t regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They truly understand form—which is impermanent—as impermanent. They truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is impermanent—as impermanent.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Sāriputta, this is how it is when you have such venerables as spiritual companions to advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion. And after hearing this teaching by Venerable Sāriputta, my mind is freed from the defilements by not grasping.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">86. With Anurādha</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they said this, Venerable Anurādha said to those wanderers:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” When he said this, the wanderers said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.” Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seats and left.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If those wanderers were to inquire further, how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him all that had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Anurādha? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.” … “So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as form?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you regard the Realized One as feeling … perception … choices … consciousness?”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">87. With Vakkali</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Vakkali was staying in a potter’s shed, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then he addressed his carers, “Please, reverends, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is sick, suffering, and gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please go to the mendicant Vakkali out of compassion.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied. They did as he asked. The Buddha consented in silence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robes, went to Venerable Vakkali. Venerable Vakkali saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and tried to rise on his cot.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But the Buddha said to him, “It’s all right, Vakkali, don’t get up. There are some seats spread out, I will sit there.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">He sat on the seat spread out and said to Vakkali, “Vakkali, I hope you’re keeping well; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I’m not all right, I’m not getting by. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is apparent, not its fading.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I hope you don’t have any remorse or regret?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Indeed, sir, I have no little remorse and regret.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In that case, Vakkali, why do you have remorse and regret?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For a long time I’ve wanted to go and see the Buddha, but I was physically too weak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Enough, Vakkali! Why would you want to see this rotten body? One who sees the teaching sees me. One who sees me sees the teaching. Seeing the teaching, you see me. Seeing me, you see the teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Vakkali? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.” …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then, after giving Venerable Vakkali this advice, the Buddha got up from his seat and went to the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Vakkali addressed his carers, “Come on, reverends, lift my cot and take me to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. It’s unthinkable for one like me to die in an inhabited area!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and did as he asked. Meanwhile, the Buddha spent the rest of that night and day on Vulture’s Peak Mountain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">One deity said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And another deity said to him, “He’ll definitely be well-freed!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is what those deities said. Then they bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, before vanishing right there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Come, mendicants, go to the mendicant Vakkali and tell him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Vakkali, hear the word of the Buddha and two deities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Late last night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">One deity said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And another deity said to him, “He’ll definitely be well-freed!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the Buddha said, “Do not fear, Vakkali, do not fear! Your death will not be a bad one; your passing will not be a bad one.”’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” those monks replied. They went to Vakkali and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Vakkali, hear the word of the Buddha and two deities.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vakkali addressed his carers, “Please, reverends, help me off my cot. It’s unthinkable for one like me to listen to the Buddha’s instructions sitting on a high seat.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and helped him off his cot. They repeated what the Buddha had said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Vakkali said, “Well then, reverends, in my name bow with your head to the Buddha’s feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Form is impermanent. I have no doubt of that. I’m certain that what is impermanent is suffering. And I’m certain that I have no desire or greed or fondness for what is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Feeling is impermanent …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Perception is impermanent …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Choices are impermanent …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Consciousness is impermanent. I have no doubt of that. I’m certain that what is impermanent is suffering. And I’m certain that I have no desire or greed or fondness for what is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied, and left. And then, not long after those mendicants had left, Venerable Vakkali slit his wrists.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha and told him Vakkali’s message.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Come, mendicants, let’s go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili, where Vakkali, the gentleman, slit his wrists.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. The Buddha saw Vakkali off in the distance lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s Māra the Wicked searching for Vakkali’s consciousness, wondering: ‘Where is Vakkali’s consciousness established?’ But since his consciousness is not established, Vakkali is extinguished.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">89. With Khemaka</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Now at that time Venerable Khemaka was staying in the Jujube Tree Monastery, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the late afternoon those senior mendicants came out of retreat and addressed Venerable Dāsaka, “Please, Reverend Dāsaka, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors hope you’re keeping well; they hope you’re alright. They hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverends,” replied Dāsaka. He went to Khemaka and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Khemaka, the seniors hope you’re keeping well; they hope you’re alright. They hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Dāsaka went to those seniors and told them what had happened. They said,</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Please, Reverend Dāsaka, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors say that these five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Do you regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self?’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverends,” replied Dāsaka. He relayed the message to Khemaka, who replied:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“These five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. I do not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Dāsaka went to those seniors and told them what had happened. They said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Please, Reverend Dāsaka, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors say that these five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. If, as it seems, Venerable Khemaka does not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self, then he is a perfected one, with defilements ended.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverends,” replied Dāsaka. He relayed the message to Khemaka, who replied:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“These five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. I do not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self, yet I am not a perfected one, with defilements ended. For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Dāsaka went to those seniors and told them what had happened. They said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Please, Reverend Dāsaka, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors ask, when you say ‘I am’, what is it that you’re talking about? Is it form or apart from form? Is it feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness? When you say ‘I am’, what is it that you’re talking about?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverends,” replied Dāsaka. He relayed the message to Khemaka, who replied:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Enough, Reverend Dāsaka! What’s the point in running back and forth? Bring my staff, I’ll go to see the senior mendicants myself.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Khemaka, leaning on a staff, went to those senior mendicants and exchanged greetings with them. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. They said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Khemaka, when you say ‘I am’, what is it that you’re talking about? Is it form or apart from form? Is it feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness? When you say ‘I am’, what is it that you’re talking about?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to form, or apart from form. I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness. For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s like the scent of a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Would it be right to say that the scent belongs to the petals or the stalk or the pistil?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then, reverends, how should it be said?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It would be right to say that the scent belongs to the flower.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, reverends, I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to form, or apart from form. I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness. For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Although a noble disciple has given up the five lower fetters, they still have a lingering residue of the conceit ‘I am’, the desire ‘I am’, and the underlying tendency ‘I am’ which has not been eradicated. After some time they meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ As they do so, that lingering residue is eradicated.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a cloth that was dirty and soiled, so the owners give it to a launderer. The launderer kneads it thoroughly with salt, lye, and cow dung, and rinses it in clear water. Although that cloth is clean and bright, it still has a lingering scent of salt, lye, or cow dung that had not been eradicated. The launderer returns it to its owners, who store it in a chest permeated with scent. And that lingering scent would be eradicated.</p>

<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the senior mendicants said to Venerable Khemaka, “We didn’t want to trouble Venerable Khemaka with our questions. But you’re capable of explaining, teaching, advocating, establishing, disclosing, analyzing, and clarifying the Buddha’s instructions in detail. And that’s just what you’ve done.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s what Venerable Khemaka said. Satisfied, the senior mendicants were happy with what Venerable Khemaka said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty senior mendicants and of Venerable Khemaka were freed from defilements by not grasping.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">90. With Channa</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Channa came out of retreat. Taking a key, he went from dwelling to dwelling, going up to the senior mendicants and saying, “May the venerable senior mendicants advise me and instruct me! May they give me a Dhamma talk so that I can see the teaching!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the senior mendicants said to Venerable Channa:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Channa, form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent. Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Channa thought, “I too think in this way. … And yet my mind isn’t eager, confident, settled, and decided about the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. Anxiety and grasping arise. And the mind reverts to thinking: ‘So then who exactly is my self?’ But that doesn’t happen for someone who sees the teaching. Who can teach me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Channa thought, “The Venerable Ānanda is staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. He’s praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. He’s quite capable of teaching me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching. Since I have so much trust in Venerable Ānanda, why don’t I go to see him?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Channa set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Kosambi. He went to see Ānanda in Ghosita’s Monastery, exchanged greetings with him, and told him what had happened. Then he said,</p>
<p class="bodytext">“May Venerable Ānanda advise me and instruct me! May he give me a Dhamma talk so that I can see the teaching!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’m already delighted with Venerable Channa. Hopefully you’ve opened yourself up and cut through your emotional barrenness. Listen well, Channa. You are capable of understanding the teaching.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then right away Channa was filled with lofty rapture and joy, “It seems I’m capable of understanding the teaching!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Channa, I heard and learned in the presence of the Buddha his advice to the mendicant Kaccānagotta:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Kaccāna, this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of existence regarding the world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The world is for the most part shackled to attraction, grasping, and insisting.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But if—when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency—you don’t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion “my self”, you’ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing. Your knowledge about this is independent of others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is how right view is defined.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“All exists”: this is one extreme.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“All doesn’t exist”: this is the second extreme.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Ānanda, this is how it is when you have such venerables as spiritual companions to advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion. And now that I’ve heard this teaching from Venerable Ānanda, I’ve comprehended the teaching.”</p>

If wild sugarcane, kusa grass, reeds, vetiver, or trees grew on either bank, they’d overhang the river. And if a person who was being swept along by the current grabbed the wild sugarcane, kusa grass, reeds, vetiver, or trees, it’d break off, and they’d come to ruin because of that.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Ayojjhā on the bank of the Ganges river. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, suppose this Ganges river was carrying along a big lump of foam. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a lump of foam?</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; near or far—examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in form?</p>

And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial.

<p class="bodytext">In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of feeling at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in feeling?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose that in the last month of summer, at noon, a shimmering mirage appears. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully.

<p class="bodytext">In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of perception at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in perception?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a banana tree?</p>

I had 84,000 couches made of ivory or heartwood or gold or silver, spread with woolen covers—shag-piled or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends. I had 84,000 bull elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the royal bull elephant named Sabbath the foremost. I had 84,000 horses with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the royal steed named Thundercloud the foremost.

I had 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, silk, wool, and cotton. I had 84,000 servings of food, which were presented to me as offerings in the morning and evening.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Of those 84,000 cities, I only stayed in one, the capital Kusāvatī. Of those 84,000 mansions, I only dwelt in one, the Palace of Principle.

Of those 84,000 chariots, I only rode one, the chariot named Triumph. Of those 84,000 women, I was only served by one, a maiden of the aristocratic or merchant classes.

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when what exists, because of grasping what and insisting on what, does the view arise: ‘Winds don’t blow; rivers don’t flow; pregnant women don’t give birth; the moon and stars neither rise nor set, but stand firm like a pillar.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When form exists, because of grasping form and insisting on form, the view arises: ‘Winds don’t blow; rivers don’t flow; pregnant women don’t give birth; the moon and stars neither rise nor set, but stand firm like a pillar.’ When feeling … perception … choices … consciousness exists, because of grasping consciousness and insisting on consciousness, the view arises: ‘Winds don’t blow; rivers don’t flow; pregnant women don’t give birth; the moon and stars neither rise nor set, but stand firm like a pillar.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But by not grasping what’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, would the view arise: ‘Winds don’t blow; rivers don’t flow; pregnant women don’t give birth; the moon and stars neither rise nor set, but stand firm like a pillar’?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when what exists, because of grasping what and insisting on what, does the view arise: ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There are no duties to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight. This person is made up of the four primary elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air. The faculties are transferred to space. Four men with a bier carry away the corpse. Their footprints show the way to the cemetery. The bones become bleached. Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes. Giving is a doctrine of morons. When anyone affirms a positive teaching it’s just baseless, false nonsense. Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and don’t exist after death’?”</p>

Nothing bad is done when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when what exists, because of grasping what and insisting on what, does the view arise: ‘There are these seven substances that are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other. What seven? The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh. These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other. If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life. The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances. There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 <i>Ājīvaka</i> ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven embryos without attachments. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven winds, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering. And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little”—for that cannot be. Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling. In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering’?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“When form exists, because of grasping form and insisting on form, the view arises: ‘The self is neither happy nor suffering, and is sound after death.’ When feeling … perception … choices … consciousness exists, because of grasping consciousness and insisting on consciousness, the view arises: ‘The self is neither happy nor suffering, and is sound after death.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Dark Forest, plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat and went to Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Venerable Ānanda saw him coming off in the distance, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Sāriputta, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. What meditation were you practicing today?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. But it didn’t occur to me: ‘I am entering the first absorption’ or ‘I have entered the first absorption’ or ‘I am emerging from the first absorption’.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, I entered and remained in the cessation of perception and feeling. But it didn’t occur to me: ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago totally eradicated ego, possessiveness, and the underlying tendency to conceit. That’s why it didn’t occur to you: ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">10. With Sucimukhī</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then he robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. After wandering indiscriminately for alms-food in Rājagaha, he ate his alms-food by a wall.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the wanderer Sucimukhī went up to Venerable Sāriputta and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ascetic, do you eat facing downwards?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sister.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, do you eat facing upwards?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sister.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, do you eat facing the cardinal directions?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sister.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, do you eat facing the intermediate directions?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sister.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When asked if you eat facing all these directions, you answer ‘no, sister’. How exactly do you eat, ascetic?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sister, those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by geomancy—an unworthy branch of knowledge, a wrong livelihood—are said to eat facing downwards.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by astrology—an unworthy branch of knowledge, a wrong livelihood—are said to eat facing upwards.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by running errands and messages—a wrong livelihood—are said to eat facing the cardinal directions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by palmistry—an unworthy branch of knowledge, a wrong livelihood—are said to eat facing the intermediate directions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I don’t earn a living by any of these means. I seek alms in a principled manner, and I eat it in a principled manner.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sucimukhī the wanderer went around Rājagaha from street to street, from square to square, and announced: “The Sakyan ascetics eat food in a principled manner! The Sakyan ascetics eat food blamelessly! Give almsfood to the Sakyan ascetics!”</p>
