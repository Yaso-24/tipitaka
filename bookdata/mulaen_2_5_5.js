<h2 class="title">1.4. The Farmer Bhāradvaja</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus have i heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Radiant One was dwelling among the Magadhans at South Mountain near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷā. Now at that time the brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja had five hundred ploughs fastened to their yokes at the time of “planting”. Then in the morning the Radiant One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the place where the brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja was working.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As that time the brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja’s food distribution was happening. Then the Radiant One approached the place for the distribution of food and stood to one side. The brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja saw the Radiant One standing for alms and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Samaṇa, I plough and plant, and when I have ploughed and planted, I eat. You too, samaṇa, ought to plough and plant; then when you have ploughed and planted, you will eat.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But I too, brahmin, plough and plant, and when I have ploughed and planted, I eat.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But we do not see Master Gotama’s yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxen; yet Master Gotama says, “I too brahmin, plough and plant, and when I have ploughed and planted, I eat.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja addressed the Radiant One in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Kasī-Bhāradvāja</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> A ploughman, so you claim to be </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> but we see not your ploughmanship. </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">My body’s guarded, so is my speech, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Restrained is my belly’s food, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The act of Truth is my cutting-off, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Gentleness is my release.</p>
<p class="bodytext">My harnessed ox is energy— </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> draws safe for yoking’s end, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> goes to where no sorrow is </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> and turns not back again.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In this way is my ploughing ploughed </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> towards the crop of Deathlessness— </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> who finishes this ploughing’s work </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> from all <i>dukkha</i> will be free.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Kasī-Bhāradvāja had a large bronze bowl filled with milk-rice and brought to the Radiant One. “May it please Master Gotama to eat the milk-rice, Master Gotama is a ploughman, since he does the ploughing that has the Deathless as its crop.”</p>

When this courteous and amiable talk was finished they sat down to one side. Sitting there these brahmins of palatial abodes said, “Master Gotama, are there now to be seen any brahmins who practise the Brahmin Dharma of the brahmins of old?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, brahmins, there are no brahmins now to be seen who practise the Brahmin Dharma of the brahmins of old.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">That rajah, Lord of chariots, </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">“Speech having four qualities is well-spoken, not ill-spoken, and blameless, not blameworthy, among the wise. What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu speaks only what is well-spoken, not what is ill-spoken; what is Dharma, not what is not-Dharma; what is kindly, not what is unkind; what is the truth, not what is false. This speech is well-spoken, not ill-spoken, and blameless, not blameworthy among the wise.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is what the Radiant One said, then he spoke further.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now peaceful Ones say: first speak the well-spoken, </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">thus have i heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Radiant One was dwelling among the Kosalans. At that time the brahmin Sundarika-Bhāradvāja performed on the bank of the Sundarika river the fire sacrifice and offered the fire-ritual. Having completed the sacrifice and ritual the brahmin rose from his seat and surveyed the four directions, thinking, “Who will partake of the remains of this sacrifice?” It happened then that the brahmin saw the Radiant One seated at the foot of a tree not far away, but with his head covered. Seeing him, the brahmin grasped the sacrificial remains in his left hand and a water-vessel in his right and approached the Radiant One who, hearing his approach, uncovered his head. Then the brahmin thought:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This venerable one is shaven-headed, a mere shaveling” and desired to turn back. But it occurred to him: “Though shaven-headed there are some brahmins here like this. It would be good to inquire about his ‘birth’.” Then Sundarika-Bhāradvāja the brahmin approached the Radiant One and having done so, said this: “Of what ‘birth’ is the venerable one?” Then the Radiant One addressed these verses to the brahmin:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Buddha</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> No brahmin am I, nor son of royalty, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> nor of merchant stock, nor any other (caste), </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> My head is shaven, I am fully quenched; </p end="">

I go for Refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma, and to the Bhikkhu-Saṅgha that I may receive the Leaving home from the venerable Gotama with ordination.” Then the brahmin Sundarika-Bhāradvāja received this.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Not long after his ordination the venerable, living in solitude, secluded, diligent and zealous by realizing from himself with Direct Knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the Good Life for the sake of which clansmen rightly leave home for homelessness. He Knew directly: birth is destroyed, the Good Life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being. And the venerable Sundarika-Bhāradvāja became one of the arahants.</p>

<h2 class="title">3.6. Sabhiya’s Questions</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus have i heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Radiant One dwelt at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding-ground. Now at that time a deva gave a question to Sabhiya the Wanderer, who had been his relative in a past life, saying, “Sabhiya, if any ascetic or brahmin can answer this question, you should live the Holy Life with them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When Sabhiya the Wanderer had learned that question from the deva, he approached various respected ascetics and brahmins and asked them the question. These included teachers with large followings and many devotees, well-known and famous, well-regarded by many people as having crossed over, such as Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosālo, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāna, Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta. But when they were asked this question, they were not able to answer, and they showed unreasonable anger and annoyance. Then they asked Sabhiya questions in return.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to Sabhiya, “These teachers are not able to answer my question, and instead they ask me about something else. Perhaps I should return to the lesser life and enjoy sensual pleasures.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then he thought, “There is also this Ascetic Gotama, who is a teacher with a large following and many devotees, well-known and famous, well-regarded by many people as having crossed over. Why don’t I go and ask him this question?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But then it occurred to him, “The respected ascetics and brahmins who I asked previously—Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosālo, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāna, Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—were not able to answer me, and they are old, elderly, great figures, come to the last stage of life, seniors, long gone forth. How could this Ascetic Gotama answer my question, since he is young, and only recently gone forth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then he thought, “An ascetic should not be despised or held in contempt just because they are young. The Ascetic Gotama is young, but he is of great psychic power and might. Why don’t I go to him and ask this question?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Wanderer Sabhiya then set out for Rājagaha. Wandering by stages he arrived at Rājagaha and went to the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel’s Feeding Place. He approached the Buddha, exchanged courteous and amiable greetings with him, and sat down to one side. Then he addressed the Buddha with the following verses.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Sabhiya</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> I have come filled with doubts, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Wishing to ask a question; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> When I ask them, please put them to rest, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> By explaining each and every matter to me.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Buddha</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Sabhiya, you have come from afar, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Wishing to ask a question; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> When you ask them, I will put them to rest, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> By explaining each and every matter to you.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ask me, Sabhiya, your question, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Whatever you wish, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> I will put to rest </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Each and every question.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to Sabhiya the Wanderer: “How amazing! How incredible! With those other ascetics and brahmins I couldn’t get so much as an opportunity, while this Ascetic Gotama makes the opportunity himself!” Pleased and joyful, uplifted with rapture and happiness, he asked the Buddha this question.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Sabhiya</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Attaining what is one called a “bhikkhu”? </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> How is one “gentle”? And how “tamed”? </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">Then Sabhiya the Wanderer rejoiced, thankful for the Buddha’s answer.

<p class="bodytext">And then Sabhiya the wanderer, fell at the Buddha’s feet and said to him: “Amazing, venerable sir, incredible, venerable sir! It is as if someone were to turn upright what had been overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to light a lamp in the darkness, so that those with eyes could see. In the same way the Buddha has made the Dhamma clear in many ways. I go to the Buddha for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the monastic Saṅgha. Bhante, I ask for the going forth and ordination in the Lord’s presence.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sabhiya, anyone who was previously a follower of another sect and who asks for going forth and ordination in this Dhamma and Vinaya should stay on probation for four months. When four months have passed, the monastics, if they are satisfied, may give the going forth and ordination into the status of a bhikkhu. However, I also consider individual cases differently.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir, in that case I will remain on probation for four years, and after four years if the monastics are satisfied they may give me the going forth and ordination into the status of a bhikkhu.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sabhiya the Wanderer received the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence. … And he became one of the arahants.</p>

<h2 class="title">3.7. To Sela and his Praise of the Buddha</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus have i heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Radiant One was journeying through the lands of the Aṅguttarāpans, accompanied by a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, twelve hundred and fifty of them and arrived at a town called Āpaṇa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The ascetic Keṇiya of the Dreadlocked Hair heard this: “The Samaṇa Gotama, son of the Sakiyans who left home among the Sakyan people has been journeying among the Aṅguttarāpans accompanied by a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, twelve hundred and fifty of them, and he has arrived in Āpaṇa. Now an excellent report has spread to this effect: “The Radiant One is an Arahant, fully Awakened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, whose going is auspicious, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of people to be famed, Teacher of devas and humanity, Awakened and Radiant. He declares this world with its devas, Māras, princes and people which he has realized by direct knowledge himself. He teaches Dharma good at the beginning, the middle and the end, complete with purpose and meaning, revealing the good life, that which is completely fulfilled and wholly purified.” Now, it is good to see such Arahants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Keṇiya of the Dreadlocked Hair went to see the Radiant One and exchanged greetings with him and when that courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down to one side. The Radiant One instructed, urged, roused and encouraged him with Dharma-talk after which Keṇiya said, “Let Master Gotama together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Radiant One replied to him, “The Saṅgha of bhikkhus Keṇiya, is large, of twelve hundred and fifty. And you have confidence also in the brahmins.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">This request was repeated a second and a third time by Keṇiya, and only on the third occasion did the Buddha accept by remaining silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Keṇiya, knowing that the Buddha had accepted, paid respects, rose from his seat and went to his own hermitage. He addressed his friends and colleagues, family and relatives, saying “Listen, my good friends and colleagues, family and relatives! I have invited the ascetic Gotama for the meal tomorrow, together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Would you assist me with the various duties?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” agreed Keṇiya’s friends and colleagues, family and relatives. And some dug out the ovens, some chopped wood, some washed the dishes, some put out the water pot, while others prepared the seats. And in the evening, Keṇiya set up a pavilion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the brahmin Sela was visting Āpaṇa. He was an expert in the three Vedas, with the etymologies, the rituals, the phonology and word analysis, and fifthly the legendary histories. He was a linguist, a grammarian, a cosmologist, and an expert in the marks of a Superman. He taught the Vedic texts to three hundred young students.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Keṇiya of the Dreadlocked Hair had confidence in the brahmin Sela. Then Sela accompanied by his three hundred students were out for a walk, and they came to the hermitage of Keṇiya. Sela saw the activity in the hermitage and said to Keṇiya, “Master Keṇiya, are your son or daughter being married, or are you preparing a great sacrifice, or have you invited Seniya Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, tomorrow together with his army?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, Sela, there is no marriage, nor has the king been invited. However I am preparing a great sacrifice. There is this ascetic Gotama, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, and he has arrived at Āpaṇa together with a great Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Now an excellent report has spread to this effect: ‘The Radiant One is an Arahant, fully Awakened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, whose going is auspicious, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of people to be famed, Teacher of devas and humanity, Awakened and Radiant.’ I have invited him for the meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Keṇiya, did you say ‘Awakened’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, Sela, I said ‘Awakened’!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Keṇiya, did you say ‘Awakened’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, Sela, I said ‘Awakened’!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to the brahmin Sela: “It is hard to even hear the word ‘Awakened’ in the world today. There has come down in our sacred scriptures the thirty-two marks of a Superman, possessing which a Superman has two destinies, no other. If he dwells at home he will be a king, a just emperor, a just king, conqueror of the four directions, who has stabilized the realm, and possesses the seven treasures. And these are his seven treasures: the Wheel treasure, the elephant treasure, the horse treasure, the jewel treasure, the woman treasure, the householder treasure, and seventh, the adviser treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are valiant, heroic, crushers of the armies of foes. Having conquered this earth to the shores of the seas he rules justly, without weapons or violence. But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness, then he becomes an arahant, a fully awakened Buddha, one who draws back the veil from the world.” “So where now, Master Keṇiya, is that Master Gotama living, the arahant, the fully awakened Buddha?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Keṇiya of the Dreadlocked hair took the brahmin Sela by the right arm and said, “There, where that line of blue forest is, master Sela.” Then Sela with his three hundred students approached the Buddha. Sela addressed his students, saying, “Come quietly, sirs! Place each step one after the other! For the Buddhas are hard to approach, like lions living alone. And when I am conversing with the ascetic Gotama, don’t interrupt our discussion, but wait until we have finished.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then Sela approached the Buddha, engaged in polite greetings and conversation, and sat down to one side. He scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a Superman. He saw most of them, except for two, regarding which he had doubts: whether the private parts were sheathed, and the tongue was long.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha knew that Sela saw most of the thirty-two marks, but doubted two. So he performed an act of psychic power such that Sela could see that his private parts were sheathed. Then he put out his tongue and licked both his ears, and both his nostrils, and covered his whole forehead with his tongue.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to Sela: “The ascetic Gotama does indeed possess all of the thirty-two marks of a Superman. But I do not know whether he is awakened or not. I have heard it said by elder and respected brahmins, the teachers of teachers, that whoever is an arahant, a fully awakened Buddha, will reveal themselves when their own praise is spoken. Why don’t I praise the ascetic Gotama in his presence with suitable verses?” Then the brahmin Sela spoke the following.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Sela</i> </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> Crusher of Māra’s armies; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Having subjugated all my enemies, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> I rejoice, afraid of nothing.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Sela</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Good sirs, listen up </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> As the seer speaks, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The surgeon, the great hero, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Roars like a lion in the forest.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He is supreme, he is incomparable, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Crusher of Māra’s armies; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Who seeing him would not be inspired, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Unless their nature was dark?</p>
<p class="bodytext">What I wished for has arrived, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> What I didn’t wish for has departed; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Right now I will go forth, </p end="">

<p class="bodytext"><i>Pupils</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> If this is your pleasure, sir, </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> In the presence of the one of excellent wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Narrator</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Then these three hundred brahmins </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Asked, with palms folded: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> “We would live the Holy Life </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> In the presence of the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Buddha</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The Holy Life is well-explained, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Apparent here and now, realizable in this very life, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Wherein the going forth is not fruitless, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> For one who trains themselves diligently.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the brahmin Sela and his following gained the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence. When the night had passed, Keṇiya of the Dreadlocked Hair, having prepared much fine food in his hermitage, had the time announced to the Buddha: “It is time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” In the morning, the Buddha dressed, took his bowl and robe, went to Keṇiya’s hermitage, and sat on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Keṇiya served and satisfied the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head with fine food. Then when the Buddha had finished eating and had taken his hand from his bowl, Keṇiya sat at one side on a low seat, where the Buddha expressed his appreciation with the following verses.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Buddha</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The fire-oblation is the foremost of sacrifices; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The Sāvitrī is the foremost of poetic styles; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> A king is the foremost of humans; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The ocean is the foremost of rivers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The moon is the foremost of heavenly bodies; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The sun the foremost of fires; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> But for those wishing to do good, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> An offering to the Saṅgha is foremost.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Keṇiya with these verses, he got up from his seat and left.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Sela and his following, living in solitude, secluded, diligent and zealous by realizing for themselves with Direct Knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the Holy Life for the sake of which clansmen rightly leave home for homelessness. They Knew directly: birth is destroyed, the Holy Life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being. And the venerable Sela and his following became arahants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sela and his following approached the Buddha, arranged their robes over one shoulder, extended their folded palms, and spoke the following verses:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Sela</i> </p end="">

<h2 class="title">3.9. To Vāseṭṭha on Who is a Brahmin</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus have i heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Radiant One was dwelling at Icchānaṅgala. Now at that time a number of notable and prosperous brahmins were staying at Icchānangala, that is to say the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoni and Todeyya, as well as other notable and prosperous brahmins.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, as the young brahmins Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvaja were walking and wandering for exercise this subject of discussion arose between them. “How is one a brahmin?” The young brahmin Bhāradvaja said, “When one is well-born on both sides, of pure maternal and paternal descent through seven generations in the past, then one is a brahmin”.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But Vāseṭṭha the young brahmin said, “When one is virtuous and fulfils one’s vows, then one is a brahmin”. Bhāradvaja could not convince Vāseṭṭha while the latter failed to convince the former.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvaja, “Sir, the samaṇa Gotama son of the Sakyas who left home from the Sakyan clan is living at Icchānaṅgala, in the forest near Icchānaṅgala. Now the good reputation of Master Gotama has spread in this way: ‘That Radiant One is accomplished, completely Awakened, possessed of True Knowledge and conduct, well-gone for himself and others, knower of the worlds, unexcelled trainer of those who can be tamed, teacher of devas and humanity, Awake and Radiant.’ Come, Bhāradvaja, let us go to the samaṇa Gotama and ask him about this. As he replies, so will we bear his words in mind.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir”, Bharadvaja replied.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the two young brahmins approached the Radiant One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was concluded, they sat down to one side, and the young brahmin Vāseṭṭha addressed the Radiant One in verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Vāseṭṭha</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Of Pokkharasāti the pupil I am, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> while student of Tārukkha is he; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> both of us have acknowledged mastery </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> in the threefold Veda lore.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We have attained totality </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> over all the Vedic masters teach; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> as philologists, grammarians, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> and we chant as our masters do.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The subject of “birth”, O Gotama, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> is contention’s cause with us: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> he, a Bhāradvāja, does declare </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> “birth” is due to brahmin caste, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> while I say it’s by karma caused: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> know it thus, O One-with-Eyes.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sir, to ask about this we have come, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> to you acclaimed as Wide Awake, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> each of us unable is </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> the other to convince.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As they raise their lotussed hands </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> towards the moon waxed full, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> so to you, by this world revered, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> we pay homage too.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So now of Gotama the Eye </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> uprisen in the world, we ask: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Is one by “birth” a brahmin, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> or a brahmin karma-caused? </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Explain to us who do not know </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> how we should “brahmin” recognize?</p>

<p class="centered">sutta nipāta</p>
<p class="centered">kokāliya sutta</p>
<h2 class="title">3.10. To Kokāliya on the Results of Slander</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus have i heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Radiant One was dwelling at Jeta’s Grove in the park of Anāthapiṇḍika near Sāvatthī. Now at that time the bhikkhu Kokāliya approached the Radiant One, and having done so saluted him and sat down to one side. Seated there Kokāliya bhikkhu said this to the Radiant One: “Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna are of evil desires, under the influence of evil desires.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said the Radiant One spoke to the bhikkhu Kokāliya: “Don’t say this Kokāliya, don’t say so! Clear your mind towards Sāriputta and Moggallāna for they are very friendly.” A second time Kokāliya repeated his allegation and the Radiant One replied in the same way. An even a third time Kokāliya spoke his accusation and the Radiant One replied.</p>
<p class="bodytext">After this the bhikkhu Kokāliya rose from his seat, saluted the Radiant One and circumambulating him, keeping him on the right, departed. Only a short time after he left, Kokāliya’s whole body broke out in boils the size of mustard seeds, then grew to the size of green-gram, then to chickpeas, then to jujube seeds, then to jujube fruits, then to myrobalan fruits, then to young bael fruits, then to mature bael fruits, and when they had reached this size all over his body, blood and pus was discharged and Kokāliya died. After death, he appeared in the Paduma Hell as a result of hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then as the night passed, Brahmā Sahampati of great radiance illuming the whole of Jetavana, came to the Radiant One and after saluting him stood to one side and said this: “Venerable, the bhikkhu Kokāliya has died and appeared subsequently in the Paduma Hell as a result of hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, a certain bhikkhu spoke to the Radiant One thus: “How long, venerable, is life in the Paduma Hell?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Bhikkhu, life in the Paduma hell is surely long, not easy to reckon in terms of years, of hundreds of years, of thousand of years, in tens of hundreds of thousands of years.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But can a simile be made, sir?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It can, bhikkhu. Suppose that there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesame seed, and that from this a man might take a single seed every century. That Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesame seeds would be more quickly used up in that way than would a lifetime in the Paduma Hell. Moreover, bhikkhu, there are twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda Hell to equal one in Nirabbuda Hell … twenty in Nirabbuda to equal one Ababa … twenty in Ababa to equal one Aṭaṭa … twenty in Aṭaṭa to equal one Ahaha … twenty in Ahaha equal to one Kumuda … one Sogandhika … one Uppālaka … one Puṇḍarīka … one Paduma. It is in Paduma that Kokāliya bhikkhu has arisen for hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Radiant One spoke thus and having said this spoke further (these verses).</p>

<h2 class="title">3.11. The Sages Asita and Nālaka and the Buddha’s advice</h2>
<p class="centered">Prologue—Telling the story</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Narrator</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> In midday meditation the sage Asita saw </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> brilliantly arrayed the thrice-ten deva troop, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> happy and joyful waving flags the while, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> with Sakka their superior all highly elated. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Then when he had seen the devas so delighted </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> respectfully he greeted them and questioned them like this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">Why is this deva-Saṅgha so exceedingly joyful </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> they’ve brought along banners for brandishing about? </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Even when the devas battled anti-gods </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> with a win for deva-hosts, and loss for demon-hordes, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> then was no such celebration— so what have devas seen? </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> What wonder have they heard? Why devas are delighted? </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They whistle and they sing, clap hands and strum sitars; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> with dancing and with music, so they celebrate. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> O you deva-dwellers on Meru’s airy peaks, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> I beg you, good sirs, soon dispel my doubts.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Devas</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> A Bodhisattva has been born in the Sakyans’ city, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> in lands along Lumbini. Precious gem beyond compare, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> for the weal and welfare of those in the human realm. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> That’s why we’re delighted and completely overjoyed. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> He, best being of all, foremost among mankind, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> mighty bull among men, of creatures all supreme, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> will revolve the wheel in ancient seers’ woods, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> likened to a roaring lion, mightiest of beasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Narrator</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Having known this news, then the sage in haste </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> in mind descended to Suddhodana’s abode, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> sat he down and said:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Asita</i> Where then is this prince? I wish to see him now!</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Narrator</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> So Sakyans he beseeched. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Then to him Asita named did Sakyans show their son, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> the prince in colour clear as rays from shining gold, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> burnished and illustrious both of supernal hue. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Joy with rapture great filled Asita’s heart </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> on perceiving this young prince, bright as crested flame, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> pure like the lunar lord stars herding through the sky, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> dazzling as the sun on cloudless autumn days. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Sky beings all above carried canopy of state </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> of many-tiered parasols as well as gold-handled whisks— </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> but no one saw the bearers of the whisks and parasols. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The sage with dreadlocked hair, also Kaṇhasiri called, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> seeing then the prince— golden jewel upon brocade, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> white parasols of state held above his head— </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> received him in his arms with gladdened mind and joy. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> As soon as he received the foremost Sakyan man, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> he, skilled in lore of signs and mastery of mantras, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> exclaimed:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Asita</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Highest, unexcelled among the race of men!</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Narrator</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> But recollected then that soon, so soon, he’d die. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Seeing the sobbing prince, the Sakyans asked of him:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Sakyans</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Surely for this prince no peril will befall?</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Narrator</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The sage in answer said to anxious Sakyan’s throng:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Asita</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> “No fears do I foresee to come upon the prince, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> nor any harm at all in future will befall, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> nor he’s unfortunate, so do not be depressed, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> for he will touch upon Enlightenment divine </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> and turn the Dharma wheel. Seer of perfect purity, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> with compassion for the many, he will set forth the goodly life. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> But I’ve only brief time left within my life, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> while in this time I’ll die, having no chance to hear </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> the Dharma of that one of power incomparable; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> this saddens me so, such loss distresses me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Narrator</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Having roused in Sakyans this joy profound, the sage, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> keeper of pure precepts, left inner palace suites. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Then of his compassion to his sister’s son set out, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> arousing in him interest in the Dharma deep:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Asita</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> From persons having heard the sound of “Buddha” word </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> who Sambodhi attained, practising the Dharma-path, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> go there, then question him, as his disciples live with him. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Practice with that radiant lord precepts of purity.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Narrator</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> So, instructed by him, whose mind set on benefit, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> who foresaw in future time perfect purity complete, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> that Nālaka, his nephew much merit stored away, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> with guarded senses waited in expectation of the victor. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Having heard of the victor’s revolution of the noble wheel, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> he went to him and saw him, that prime among the saviours, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> and trust arose in him in the greatest sage. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Then he enquired upon the Silentness supreme, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> thus coming to fulfil the sages wish.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Nālaka</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Having understood Asita’s speech— </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> that it accords with truthfulness, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Gotama, we question you </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> on dharmas gone to the further shore.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I came to homelessness but now I wish </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> as a bhikkhu to behave, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> speak to me, Sage, as I request </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> on the highest state of Silentness.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Buddha</i> </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Knowledge of Silence I’ll convey, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> hard to do, to master difficult, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> so be both firm and resolute </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> and I’ll speak upon this thing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In town there’s always praise and blame, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> so practise even-mindedness, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> guard against faults of mind— </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> fare calm and free from arrogance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As crown-fire crests </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> and forest-fuel flies up, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> so do women tempt the sage— </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">Refrain from sexual dharmas, </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">Wishes and greed give up to which </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> ordinary persons are attached, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> be one-with-vision and set out </p end="">

<h2 class="title">3.12. Observation of Dualities</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus have i heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī at the eastern Monastery, the mansion of Migāra’s Mother. Now at that time the Buddha was seating in the open, surrounded by the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. It was the <i>uposatha</i> day, the night of the fifteenth day full moon. Then the Buddha, having surveyed the Saṅgha of monks sitting silently, addressed the bhikkhus:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Bhikkhus, if they ask you, ‘What is the purpose of learning those skilful principles that are noble, emancipating, leading to full enlightenment?’ You should say to them, ‘Only for the sake of knowing in accordance with reality the duality of principles.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What duality should you speak of?</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering’, this is one observation. ‘This is the end of suffering, this is the practice leading to the end of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:</p>
<p class="bodytext">Those who do not understand suffering, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Or suffering’s origination; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Or where all suffering </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Ceases without remainder; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They do not know the path </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Leading to the stilling of suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They lack the release of the heart, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> And the release by understanding; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They are incapable of making an end, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They go again to birth and old age.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Those who do understand suffering, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> And suffering’s origination; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> And where all suffering </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Ceases without remainder; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They know the path </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> And the release by understanding; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They are capable of making an end, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They do not go again to birth and old age.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If, bhikkhus, they ask you, ‘Might there be another way of rightly observing duality?’ you should say, ‘There is’. And how is there?</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Whatever suffering arises, all is caused by attachments’, this is one observation. ‘With the complete ending of all attachments there is no arising of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sufferings come to be because of attachments </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Of many kinds in this world. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Whoever, unknowing, makes attachments, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> That dull person goes to suffering again and again. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Therefore, understanding, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> One should not make attachments, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Observing how suffering comes to be.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If, bhikkhus, they ask you, ‘Might there be another way of rightly observing duality?’ you should say, ‘There is’. And how is there?</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Whatever suffering arises, all is caused by ignorance’, this is one observation. ‘With the complete ending of all ignorance there is no arising of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:</p>
<p class="bodytext">Those who transmigrate </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Through birth and death, again and again; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> In this form of existence or some other, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They go under the sway of ignorance alone.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This ignorance really is the great deluder, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Because of which we have transmigrated for a long time, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Those beings who have arrived at understanding, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Do not go to future lives.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If, bhikkhus, they ask you, ‘Might there be another way of rightly observing duality?’ you should say, ‘There is’. And how is there?</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Whatever suffering arises, all is caused by kammic choices’, this is one observation. ‘With the complete ending of all kammic choices there is no arising of suffering’, this is a second observation.

<p class="bodytext">This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whatever suffering arises in the world, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> All is caused by kammic choices. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> With the cessation of such choices, </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> That suffering is caused by kammic choices, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> With the settling of all choices, </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">“If, bhikkhus, they ask you, ‘Might there be another way of rightly observing duality?’ you should say, ‘There is’. And how is there?</p>

<p class="bodytext">“If, bhikkhus, they ask you, ‘Might there be another way of rightly observing duality?’ you should say, ‘There is’. And how is there?</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Whatever suffering arises, all is caused by contact’, this is one observation. ‘With the complete ending of all contact there is no arising of suffering’, this is a second observation.

<p class="bodytext">This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:</p>

<p class="gatha"> They flow down the stream of lives, </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> and after approaching the first brahmin, he begged for five hundred coins.</p>
<p class="bodytext">After seeing him Bāvari invited him to take a seat, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> and he asked after his happiness and welfare, and this is the word he spoke:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Whatever kind of gift I had, all that has been given away by me, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> please excuse me brahmin, I do not have the five hundred.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If your honour will not give me what I am begging for, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> then within seven days may your head split into seven pieces!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Having made a scene the dishonest man proclaimed this fearful thing. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> After hearing this word of his, Bāvari became miserable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Going without food he dried up, and was affected by the dart of grief, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> and when his heart was like that his mind did not delight in meditation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Having seen him terrified and miserable, a God who desired his welfare, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> approached Bāvari, and this is the word he spoke:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He does not know the head—he is a dishonest man who wants wealth! </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> He does not have knowledge about the head or head-splitting.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But now your honour knows! Please explain this to me when asked: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> the head and head-splitting, may we hear that word of yours.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I also do not know about this, I do not have this knowledge here. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The head and head-splitting! Indeed only Victors see this!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then who knows about the head and head-splitting </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> on the face of the earth? O God, please explain this to me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“From out of the city of Kapilavatthu a world leader has renounced, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> he is of king Okkāka’s line, a Sakyan’s son, a light-maker. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> He is a Sambuddha, brahmin, in everything he is perfect,</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Having attained all deep knowledges and strengths, endowed with Vision regarding all things, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> he has come to the end of all actions, in the end of all clinging he is freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He is the Buddha in the world, the Gracious One, the Visionary who teaches Teaching, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> after going there you can ask him about it, he will explain it to you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Having heard the word ‘Sambuddha’, Bāvari became elated, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> then his grief became but little, and he received great happiness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Bāvari, uplifted and elated, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> enthusiastically asked that God: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> “In which village, or again in which town, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> in which country, is the Lord of the World? </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Where having gone to can we revere the Sambuddha, the Supreme Human Being?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The Victor is in the Kosalan’s city, Sāvatthī, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> he has much wisdom, excellent and great intelligence, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> that Sakyan’s son, who is free from burden and pollutant, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> that Bull of a Man has understanding of head-splitting.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So then the brahmin addressed his students, who were perfect in the Vedas: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> “Come, young men, and I shall explain, please listen to this word of mine:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He whose manifestation in the world is always exceptional, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> has now arisen in the world, renowned as one called a ‘Sambuddha’. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Having gone quickly to Sāvatthī, you can see the Supreme Human Being.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Having seen him how will we know that he is the ‘Buddha’, O brahmin? </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> You must tell us who do not know, how we can know it is him.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There has come down to us in the Vedas the marks of a Great Man, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> they are explained as thirty-two, complete in regular order.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For whoever has on his limbs the marks of a Great Man, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> there can be just two destinies, for a third cannot be found:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If he lives in a house, when he has been victorious over this earth, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> without a stick or a sword he will rule according to the Teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if he goes forth from the house to the houseless life, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> he becomes a Cover-Remover, a Sambuddha, a Worthy One, unexcelled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“About my birth, family, and marks; lore, students and other things, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> about the head and head-splitting, you must ask in your mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If he should be a Buddha, one who sees without obstruction, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> the questions that are asked in your mind he will answer by way of speech.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After hearing Bāvari’s words, the sixteen brahmin students: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Ajita, Tissa Metteyya, Puṇṇaka, also Mettagū,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Dhotaka, and Upasīva, Nanda, and also Hemaka, </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">after worshipping Bāvari, and circumambulating him, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> they all, wearing matted-hair and deer-skins, set out for the North:</p>
<p class="bodytext">From Mūḷaka to Patiṭṭhāna first, then on to Mahissati, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> to Ujjenī, and Gonaddha, to Vedisa, and to the place called Vanasa,</p>

<p class="gatha"> to Setabya, and Kapilavatthu, and to the city of Kusinārā,</p>
<p class="bodytext">to Pāva, to Bhoganagara, to Vesāli, and to the Magadhan city Rājagaha, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> and to the Pāsāṇaka shrine, delightful, it is the mind’s delight.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Just like a thirsty man to cool water, or like a trader to great gain, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> like one scorched by the heat to shade, quickly he climbed the mountain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the Gracious One was in front of the Community of monks, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> teaching the Teaching to the bhikkhus, roaring like a lion in a forest,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ajita saw the Sambuddha, brilliant like the hundred-rayed sun, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> like the moon which has reached fullness on the fifteenth day of the month,</p>
<p class="bodytext">and after seeing on his limbs the characteristics in their fullness, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> standing cheerfully on one side he asked a question in his mind:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Speak and point out his birth, speak of his family, and marks, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> speak of his perfection in the Vedas, how many does the brahmin school?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“One hundred and twenty years his age, his family is Bāvari, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> three marks are on his limbs, he is perfect in the three Vedas.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the marks, and the traditions, with the glossaries, and the ritual, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> he schools five hundred, in his own teaching he is perfect.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Your investigation of Bāvari’s marks, O One Supreme among Men, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> O craving-cutter, make that clear, so that we are not left doubting.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He can cover his face with his tongue, there is hair between his eyebrows, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> what is covered by a cloth is ensheathed: know it is so young man.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Not hearing any question, but having heard the questions answered, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> all the people were enthusiastic, and raised their hands, thinking:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now who was it, a God, or a Brahma, or Inda, the lord of Sujā, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> who asked those questions with the mind? To whom did he make reply?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“About the head and head-splitting, Bāvari asks this question, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> please explain that O Gracious One, please remove our doubts, O seer.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Know ignorance is called the head, and understanding is the head-splitter, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> joined with confidence, mindfulness, concentration, desire, and energy.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then with great enthusiasm, being resolute, the young man, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> having put his deer-skin on one shoulder, fell placing his head at the Buddha’s feet:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The honourable brahmin Bāvari, and his students, dear Sir, </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">“May the brahmin Bāvari, together with his students, be happy! </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">“All of the doubts that Bāvari, or you, or anyone else has, </p end="">
