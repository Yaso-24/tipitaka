<p class="title">1. Love</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.1 : The Benefits of Love </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, you can expect eight benefits when the heart’s release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented. What eight? You sleep well. You wake happily. You don’t see bad dreams. Humans love you. Non-humans love you. Deities protect you. You can’t be harmed by fire, poison, or blade. If you don’t reach any higher, you’ll be reborn in a Brahmā realm. You can expect these eight benefits when the heart’s release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented.</p>
<p class="gatha0">A mindful one who develops </p>
<p class="gatha">limitless love </p>
<p class="gatha">weakens the fetters, </p>
<p class="gatha">seeing the ending of attachments.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Loving just one creature with a hateless heart </p>
<p class="gatha">makes you a good person. </p>
<p class="gatha">Compassionate for all creatures, </p>
<p class="gatha">a noble one creates abundant merit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The royal potentates conquered this land </p>
<p class="gatha">and traveled around sponsoring sacrifices— </p>
<p class="gatha">horse sacrifice, human sacrifice, </p>
<p class="gatha">the sacrifices of the ‘stick-casting’, the ‘royal soma drinking’, and the ‘unbarred’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are not worth a sixteenth part </p>
<p class="gatha">of the mind developed with love, </p>
<p class="gatha">as all the constellations of stars </p>
<p class="gatha">aren’t worth a sixteenth part of the moon’s light.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you don’t kill or encourage others to kill, </p>
<p class="gatha">don’t conquer or encourage others to conquer, </p>
<p class="gatha">with love for all sentient beings, </p>
<p class="gatha">you’ll have no enmity for anyone.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.2 : Wisdom </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase, growth, and full development once it has been acquired. What eight?</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s when a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. And they set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect. This is the first cause.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role—with a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect—from time to time they go and ask them questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. This is the second cause.</p>
<p class="bodytext">After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and mind. This is the third cause.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is the fourth cause.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. This is the fifth cause.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is the sixth cause.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When in the Saṅgha they don’t engage in motley talk or unworthy talk. Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so, or they respect noble silence. This is the seventh cause.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices. Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ This is the eighth cause.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Their spiritual companions esteem them: ‘This venerable lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. They set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect. Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality leads to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This venerable lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role, and from time to time they go and ask them questions … Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality also leads to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and mind. Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality also leads to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This venerable is ethical … Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality also leads to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This venerable is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. … Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality also leads to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This venerable lives with energy roused up … Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality also leads to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘When in the Saṅgha they don’t engage in motley talk or unworthy talk. Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so, or they respect noble silence. Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality also leads to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. … Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality also leads to warmth, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase, growth, and full development once it has been acquired.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.3 : Disliked (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant with eight qualities is disliked and disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired. What eight? It’s when a mendicant praises the disliked and criticizes the liked. They desire material possessions and honor. They lack conscience and prudence. They have wicked desires and wrong view. A mendicant with these eight qualities is disliked and disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant with eight qualities is liked and approved by their spiritual companions, and respected and admired. What eight? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t praise the disliked and criticize the liked. They don’t desire material possessions and honor. They have conscience and prudence. They have few desires and right view. A mendicant with these eight qualities is liked and approved by their spiritual companions, and respected and admired.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.4 : Disliked (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant with eight qualities is disliked and disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired. What eight? It’s when a mendicant desires material possessions, honor, and to be looked up to. They know neither moderation nor the proper time. Their conduct is impure, they talk a lot, and they insult and abuse their spiritual companions. A mendicant with these eight qualities is disliked and disapproved by their spiritual companions, not respected or admired.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.5 : Worldly Conditions (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around the eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain and loss, fame and disgrace, praise and blame, pleasure and pain. These eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.</p>
<p class="gatha0">Gain and loss, fame and disgrace, </p>
<p class="gatha">praise and blame, and pleasure and pain. </p>
<p class="gatha">These qualities among people are impermanent, </p>
<p class="gatha">transient, and perishable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A clever and mindful person knows these things, </p>
<p class="gatha">seeing that they’re perishable. </p>
<p class="gatha">Desirable things don’t disturb their mind, </p>
<p class="gatha">nor are they repelled by the undesirable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Both favoring and opposing </p>
<p class="gatha">are cleared and ended, they are no more. </p>
<p class="gatha">Knowing the stainless, sorrowless state, </p>
<p class="gatha">they understand rightly, going beyond rebirth.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.6 : Worldly Conditions (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around the eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain and loss, fame and disgrace, praise and blame, pleasure and pain. These eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">An uneducated ordinary person encounters gain and loss, fame and disgrace, praise and blame, and pleasure and pain. And so does an educated noble disciple. What, then, is the difference between an ordinary uneducated person and an educated noble disciple?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, an uneducated ordinary person encounters gain. They don’t reflect: ‘I’ve encountered this gain. It’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ They don’t truly understand it. They encounter loss … fame … disgrace … praise … blame … pleasure … pain. They don’t reflect: ‘I’ve encountered this pain. It’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ They don’t truly understand it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So gain and loss, fame and disgrace, praise and blame, and pleasure and pain occupy their mind. They favor gain and oppose loss. They favor fame and oppose disgrace. They favor praise and oppose blame. They favor pleasure and oppose pain. Being so full of favoring and opposing, they’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re not freed from suffering, I say.</p>
<p class="bodytext">An educated noble disciple encounters gain. They reflect: ‘I’ve encountered this gain. It’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ They truly understand it. They encounter loss … fame … disgrace … praise … blame … pleasure … pain. They reflect: ‘I’ve encountered this pain. It’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ They truly understand it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So gain and loss, fame and disgrace, praise and blame, and pleasure and pain don’t occupy their mind. They don’t favor gain or oppose loss. They don’t favor fame or oppose disgrace. They don’t favor praise or oppose blame. They don’t favor pleasure or oppose pain. Having given up favoring and opposing, they’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re freed from suffering, I say. This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person.</p>
<p class="gatha0">Gain and loss, fame and disgrace, </p>
<p class="gatha">praise and blame, and pleasure and pain. </p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.7 : Devadatta’s Failure </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, it’s good for a mendicant to check their own failings from time to time. It’s good for a mendicant to check the failings of others from time to time. It’s good for a mendicant to check their own successes from time to time. It’s good for a mendicant to check the successes of others from time to time. Overcome and overwhelmed by eight things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What eight? Overcome and overwhelmed by gain … loss … fame … disgrace … honor … dishonor … wicked desires … bad friendship, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. Overcome and overwhelmed by these eight things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s good for a mendicant, whenever they encounter it, to overcome gain … loss … fame … disgrace … honor … dishonor … wicked desires … bad friendship.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What advantage does a mendicant gain by overcoming these eight things?</p>
<p class="bodytext">The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without overcoming these eight things do not arise when they have overcome them. This is the advantage that a mendicant gains by overcoming these eight things.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, mendicants, you should train like this: ‘Whenever we encounter it, we will overcome gain … loss … fame … disgrace … honor … dishonor … wicked desires … bad friendship.’ That’s how you should train.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.8 : Uttara on Failure </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Uttara was staying on the Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in the Mahisa region near Dhavajālikā. There Uttara addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, it’s good for a mendicant to check their own failings from time to time. It’s good for a mendicant to check the failings of others from time to time. It’s good for a mendicant to check their own successes from time to time. It’s good for a mendicant to check the successes of others from time to time.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way from the north to the south on some business. He heard Venerable Uttara teaching this to the mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vessavaṇa vanished from Saṅkheyyaka Mountain and appeared among the gods of the Thirty Three, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm. Then he went up to Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Please sir, you should know this. Venerable Uttara is teaching the mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in this way: ‘It’s good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings. … the failings of others … their own successes … the successes of others.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sakka vanished from the gods of the Thirty Three and reappeared on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in front of Venerable Uttara. Then Sakka went up to Venerable Uttara, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is it really true, sir, that you teach the mendicants in this way: ‘It’s good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings … the failings of others … their own successes … the successes of others’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Indeed, lord of gods.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, did this teaching come to you from your own inspiration, or was it spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, lord of gods, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a large heap of grain not far from a town or village. And a large crowd were to take away grain with carrying poles, baskets, hip sacks, or their cupped hands. If someone were to go to that crowd and ask them where they got the grain from, how should that crowd rightly reply?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, they should reply that they took it from the large heap of grain.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, lord of gods, whatever is well spoken is spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Both myself and others rely completely on that when we speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How well this was said by Venerable Uttara! ‘Whatever is well spoken is spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Both myself and others rely completely on that when we speak.’ At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Mendicants, it’s good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings … the failings of others … their own successes … the successes of others. Overcome and overwhelmed by eight things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. What eight? Overcome and overwhelmed by gain … loss … fame … disgrace … honor … dishonor … wicked desires … bad friendship, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. Overcome and overwhelmed by these eight things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s good for a mendicant, whenever they encounter it, to overcome gain … loss … fame … disgrace … honor … dishonor … wicked desires … bad friendship.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What advantage does a mendicant gain by overcoming these eight things?</p>
<p class="bodytext">The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without overcoming these eight things do not arise when they have overcome them. This is the advantage that a mendicant gains by overcoming these eight things.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Whenever we encounter it, we will overcome gain … loss … fame … disgrace … honor … dishonor … wicked desires … bad friendship.” That’s how you should train.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sir, Uttara, this exposition of the teaching is not established anywhere in the four assemblies— monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Sir, learn this exposition of the teaching! Memorize this exposition of the teaching! Remember this exposition of the teaching! Sir, this exposition of the teaching is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.9 : Nanda </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, you could rightly call Nanda ‘Gentleman’, ‘strong’, ‘lovely’, and ‘lustful’. How could he live the full and pure spiritual life unless he guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, is dedicated to wakefulness, and has mindfulness and situational awareness?</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is how Nanda guards the sense doors. If he has to look to the east, he wholeheartedly concentrates before looking, thinking: ‘When I look to the east, bad, unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm me.’ In this way he’s aware of the situation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If he has to look to the west … north … south … up … down … If he has to survey the intermediate directions, he wholeheartedly concentrates before looking, thinking: ‘When I survey the intermediate directions, bad, unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm me.’ In this way he’s aware of the situation. This is how Nanda guards the sense doors.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is how Nanda eats in moderation. Nanda reflects properly on the food he eats: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ This is how Nanda eats in moderation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness. Nanda practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying his mind from obstacles. In the evening, he continues to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, he lies down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, he gets up and continues to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying his mind from obstacles. This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is how Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness. Nanda knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This is how Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">How could Nanda live the full and pure spiritual life unless he guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, is dedicated to wakefulness, and has mindfulness and situational awareness?”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.10 : Trash </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Now at that time the mendicants accused a mendicant of an offense. The accused mendicant dodged the issue, distracted the discussion with irrelevant points, and displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, throw this person out! Throw this person out! This person should be shown the door. Why should you be vexed by an outsider?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the mendicants don’t notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he’s a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When they realize this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn’t corrupt good-natured mendicants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose in a growing field of barley some bad barley appeared, just useless trash. Its roots, stem, and leaves would look just the same as the healthy barley. That is, so long as the head doesn’t appear. But when the head appears, they know that it’s bad barley, just useless trash. When they realize this they pull it up by the roots and throw it outside the field. Why is that? So that it doesn’t spoil the good barley.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the mendicants don’t notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he’s a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When they realize this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn’t corrupt good-natured mendicants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose that a large heap of grain is being winnowed. The grains that are firm and substantial form a heap on one side. And the grains that are flimsy and insubstantial are blown over to the other side. Then the owners take a broom and sweep them even further away. Why is that? So that it doesn’t spoil the good grain. In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the mendicants don’t notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he’s a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When they realize this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn’t corrupt good-natured mendicants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a man needs an irrigation gutter for a well. He’d take a sharp axe and enter the wood, where he’d knock various trees with the axe. The trees that were firm and substantial made a cracking sound. But the trees that were rotten inside, decomposing and decayed, made a thud. He’d cut down such a tree at the root, lop off the crown, and thoroughly clear out the insides. Then he’d use it as an irrigation gutter for the well. In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes. That is, so long as the mendicants don’t notice his offense. But when the mendicants notice the offense, they know that he’s a corrupt ascetic, just useless trash. When they realize this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn’t corrupt good-natured mendicants.</p>
<p class="gatha0">By living together, know that </p>
<p class="gatha">they’re irritable, with wicked desires, </p>
<p class="gatha">offensive, stubborn, and contemptuous, </p>
<p class="gatha">jealous, stingy, and devious.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They speak to people with a voice </p>
<p class="gatha">so smooth, just like an ascetic. </p>
<p class="gatha">But they act in secret, with their bad views </p>
<p class="gatha">and their lack of regard for others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You should recognize them for what they are: </p>
<p class="gatha">a creep and liar. </p>
<p class="gatha">Then having gathered in harmony, </p>
<p class="gatha">you should expel them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Throw out the trash! </p>
<p class="gatha">Get rid of the rubbish! </p>
<p class="gatha">And sweep away the scraps— </p>
<p class="gatha">they’re not ascetics, they just think they are.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you’ve thrown out those of wicked desires, </p>
<p class="gatha">of bad behavior and alms-resort, </p>
<p class="gatha">dwell in communion, ever mindful, </p>
<p class="gatha">the pure with the pure. </p>
<p class="gatha">Then in harmony, alert, </p>
<p class="gatha">make an end of suffering.”</p></div>

<p class="title">2. The Great Chapter</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.11 : At Verañja </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying in Verañja at the root of a neem tree dedicated to Naḷeru. Then the brahmin Verañja went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. And this is indeed the case, for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—for whom I should bow down or rise up or offer a seat. If the Realized One bowed down or rose up or offered a seat to anyone, their head would explode!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama lacks taste.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I lack taste. For the Realized One has given up taste for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I lack taste. But that’s not what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama is indelicate.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m indelicate. For the Realized One has given up delight in sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.

<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama is a teacher of inaction.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of inaction. For I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of inaction. But that’s not what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama is a teacher of annihilationism.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of annihilationism. For I teach the annihilation of greed, hate, and delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of annihilationism. But that’s not what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama is disgusted.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m disgusted. For I’m disgusted by bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m digusted. But that’s not what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama is an exterminator.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m an exterminator.

<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama is a mortifier.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m a mortifier. For I say that bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind should be mortified. I say that a mortifier is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. They’ve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. The Realized One is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a mortifier. But that’s not what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama is an abortionist.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m an abortionist. I say that an abortionist is someone who has given up future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. They’ve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. The Realized One has given up future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m an abortionist. But that’s not what you’re talking about.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose, brahmin, there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Now, the chick that is first to break out of the eggshell with its claws and beak and hatch safely: should that be called the eldest or the youngest?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master, Gotama, that should be called the eldest. For it is the eldest among them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, in this population lost in ignorance, trapped in their shells, I alone have broken open the egg of ignorance and realized the supreme perfect awakening. So, brahmin, I am the eldest and the best in the world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives. I recollected many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. This was my first breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. This was my second breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When it was freed, I knew it was freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. This was my third breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the brahmin Verañja said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama is the eldest! Master Gotama is the best! Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.12 : With Sīha </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time several very prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the meeting hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time General Sīha, a disciple of the Jains, was sitting in that assembly. He thought, “That Blessed One must certainly be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then General Sīha went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said to him, “Sir, I’d like to go to see the ascetic Gotama.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Sīha, you believe in the doctrine of action. Why should you go to see the ascetic Gotama, who teaches a doctrine of inaction? For the ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sīha’s determination to go and see the Buddha died down.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the meeting hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. And for a second time Sīha thought: “Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then General Sīha went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then for a second time Sīha’s determination to go and see the Buddha died down.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the meeting hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. And for a third time Sīha thought, “That Blessed One must certainly be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. What can these Jains do to me, whether I consult with them or not? Why don’t I, without consulting them, go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sīha, with around five hundred chariots, set out from Vesālī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and went by foot. Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.’ I trust those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism? For we don’t want to misrepresent the Blessed One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, Sīha, a sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in inaction, I teach inaction, and I guide my disciples in that way.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in action, I teach action, and I guide my disciples in that way.</p>

<p class="bodytext">And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m ambitious, I teach ambition, and I guide my disciples in that way.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what’s the sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in inaction, I teach inaction, and I guide my disciples in that way?

I’m ambitious to offer solace, the highest solace, I teach solace, and I guide my disciples in that way. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m ambitious.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, General Sīha said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sīha, you should act after careful consideration. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to act after careful consideration. For if the followers of other paths were to gain me as a disciple, they’d carry a banner all over Vesālī, saying: ‘General Sīha has become our disciple!’ And yet the Buddha tells me to act after careful consideration. For a second time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For a long time now, Sīha, your family has been a well-spring of support for the Jain ascetics. You should consider giving to them when they come.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they come. Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama says, “Gifts should only be given to me, and to my disciples. Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others. Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others.”’ Yet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain ascetics. Well, sir, we’ll know the proper time for that. For a third time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha taught Sīha step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And when the Buddha knew that Sīha’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, joyful, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in General Sīha: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sīha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha, “Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Buddha consented in silence. Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sīha got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sīha addressed a certain man, “Mister, please find out if there is any meat ready for sale.” And when the night had passed General Sīha had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sīha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Now at that time many Jain ascetics in Vesālī went from street to street and square to square, calling out with raised arms: “Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain person went up to Sīha and whispered in his ear, “Please sir, you should know this. Many Jain ascetics in Vesālī are going from street to street and square to square, calling out with raised arms: ‘Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Enough, sir. For a long time those venerables have wanted to discredit the Buddha, his teaching, and his Saṅgha. They’ll never stop misrepresenting the Buddha with their false, hollow, lying, untruthful claims. We would never deliberately take the life of a living creature, not even for life’s sake.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sīha served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sīha sat down to one side. Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.13 : A Thoroughbred </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a fine royal thoroughbred with eight factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and considered a factor of kingship. What eight?</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s when a fine royal thoroughbred is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He’s bred in the region fine thoroughbreds come from.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whatever food he’s given, fresh or dry, he eats carefully, without making a mess.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He’s disgusted by sitting or lying down in excrement or urine.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He’s sweet-natured and pleasant to live with, and he doesn’t upset the other horses.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He openly shows his tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints to his trainer, so the trainer can try to subdue them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He carries his load, determining: ‘Whether or not the other horses carry their loads, I’ll carry mine.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">He always walks in a straight path. He’s strong, and stays strong even until death.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A fine royal thoroughbred with these eight factors is worthy of a king. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, a mendicant with eight factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What eight?</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whatever food they’re given, coarse or fine, they eat carefully, without annoyance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They're disgusted with bad conduct by way of body, speech, or mind, and by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They're sweet-natured and pleasant to live with, and they doesn’t upset the other mendicants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They openly show their tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints to their sensible spiritual companions, so they can try to subdue them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They do their training, determining: ‘Whether or not the other mendicants do their training, I’ll do mine.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They always walk in a straight path. And here the straight path is right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re energetic: ‘Gladly, let my skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the blood and flesh waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by manly strength, energy, and vigor.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant with these eight factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.14 : A Wild Colt </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I will teach you about eight wild colts and eight defects in horses, and about eight wild people and eight defects in people. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what, mendicants, are the eight wild colts and eight defects in horses?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, some wild colts back right up and spin the chariot behind them. Some wild colts are like that. This is the first defect of a horse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, some wild colts jump back, wreck the hub, and break the triple rod. Some wild colts are like that. This is the second defect of a horse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, some wild colts shake the cart-pole off their thigh and trample it. Some wild colts are like that. This is the third defect of a horse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, some wild colts take a wrong turn, sending the chariot off track. Some wild colts are like that. This is the fourth defect of a horse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, some wild colts rear up and strike out with their fore-legs. Some wild colts are like that. This is the fifth defect of a horse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, some wild colts ignore the trainer and the goad, spit out the bit, and go wherever they want. Some wild colts are like that. This is the sixth defect of a horse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, some wild colts don’t step forward or turn back but stand right there still as a post. Some wild colts are like that. This is the seventh defect of a horse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, some wild colts tuck in their fore-legs and hind-legs, and sit right down on their four legs. Some wild colts are like that. This is the eighth defect of a horse. These are the eight wild colts and the eight defects in horses.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the eight wild people and eight defects in people?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the accused mendicant evades it by saying they don’t remember. I say that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, back right up and spin the chariot behind them. Some wild people are like that. This is the first defect of a person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the accused mendicant objects to the accuser: ‘What has an incompetent fool like you got to say? How on earth could you imagine you’ve got something worth saying!’ I say that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, jump back, wreck the hub, and break the triple rod. Some wild people are like that. This is the second defect of a person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the accused mendicant retorts to the accuser: ‘Well, you’ve fallen into such-and-such an offense. You should deal with that first.’ I say that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, shake the cart-pole off their thigh and trample it. Some wild people are like that. This is the third defect of a person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the accused mendicant dodges the issue, distracts the discussion with irrelevant points, and displays annoyance, hate, and bitterness. I say that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, take a wrong turn, sending the chariot off track. Some wild people are like that. This is the fourth defect of a person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the accused mendicant gesticulates while speaking in the middle of the Saṅgha. I say that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, rear up and strike out with their fore-legs. Some wild people are like that. This is the fifth defect of a person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the accused mendicant ignores the Saṅgha and the accusation and, though still guilty of the offense, they go wherever they want.

Some wild people are like that. This is the sixth defect of a person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the accused mendicant neither confesses to the offense nor denies it, but frustrates the Saṅgha by staying silent. I say that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, don’t step forward or turn back but stand right there still as a post. Some wild people are like that. This is the seventh defect of a person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the mendicants accuse a mendicant of an offense. But the accused mendicant says this: ‘Why are you venerables making so much of an issue over me? Now I’ll reject the training and return to a lesser life.’ When they have rejected the training, they say: ‘Well, venerables, are you happy now?’ I say that this person is comparable to the wild colts who, when the trainer says ‘giddyup!’ and spurs and goads them on, tuck in their fore-legs and hind-legs, and sit right down on their four legs. Some wild people are like that. This is the eighth defect of a person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the eight wild people and eight defects in people.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these eight stains. What eight? Not reciting is the stain of hymns. Neglect is the stain of houses. Laziness is the stain of beauty. Negligence is a guard’s stain. Misconduct is a woman’s stain. Stinginess is a giver’s stain. Bad, unskillful qualities are a stain in this world and the next. Worse than any of these is ignorance, the worst stain of all. These are the eight stains.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in Verañja at the root of a neem tree dedicated to Naḷeru.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Pahārāda, lord of demons, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Well, Pahārāda, do the demons love the ocean?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, they do indeed.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But seeing what incredible and amazing things do the demons love the ocean?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, seeing eight incredible and amazing things the demons love the ocean. What eight? The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt precipice. This is the first thing the demons love about the ocean.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the ocean is consistent and doesn’t overflow its boundaries. This is the second thing the demons love about the ocean.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the ocean doesn’t accommodate a corpse, but quickly carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach. This is the third thing the demons love about the ocean.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when they reach the ocean, all the great rivers—that is, the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—lose their names and clans and are simply considered ‘the ocean’. This is the fourth thing the demons love about the ocean.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, for all the world’s streams that reach it, and the rain that falls from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up. This is the fifth thing the demons love about the ocean.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans, leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, demons, dragons, and fairies. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues long. This is the eighth thing the demons love about the ocean.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Seeing eight incredible and amazing things, Pahārāda, the mendicants love this teaching and training. What eight?</p>
<p class="bodytext">The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt precipice.

This is the first thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The ocean is consistent and doesn’t overflow its boundaries. In the same way, when a training rule is laid down for my disciples they wouldn’t break it even for the sake of their own life. This is the second thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The ocean doesn’t accommodate a corpse, but quickly carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach. In the same way, the Saṅgha doesn’t accommodate a person who is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved. But they quickly gather and expel them. Even if such a person is sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha, they’re far from the Saṅgha, and the Saṅgha is far from them. This is the third thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they reach the ocean, all the great rivers—that is, the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—lose their names and clans and are simply considered ‘the ocean’. In the same way, when they go forth from the lay life to homelessness, all four castes—aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers—lose their former names and clans and are simply considered ‘Sakyan ascetics’. This is the fourth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For all the world’s streams that reach it, and the rain that falls from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up. In the same way, though several mendicants become fully extinguished through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over, the natural principle of extinguishment never empties or fills up. This is the fifth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt. In the same way, this teaching and training has one taste, the taste of freedom. This is the sixth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.20 : Sabbath </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. And then, as the night was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, “Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha has been sitting long. Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, “Sir, the night is getting late.

<p class="bodytext">But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said, “Sir, the night is getting late.

<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, the assembly is not pure.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, “Who is the Buddha talking about?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then he focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the Saṅgha. He saw that unethical person, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved, sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he saw him he got up from his seat, went up to him and said, “Get up, reverend. The Buddha has seen you. You can’t live in communion with the mendicants.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But when he said this, that person kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time …</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time …</p>
<p class="bodytext">But for a third time that person kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna took that person by the arm, ejected him out the gate, and bolted the door. Then he went up to the Buddha, and said to him, “I have ejected that person. The assembly is pure. Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the mendicants.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, Moggallāna, it’s amazing, how that silly man waited to be taken by the arm!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now, mendicants, you should perform the sabbath and recite the monastic code. From this day forth, I will not perform the sabbath or recite the monastic code.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.21 : With Ugga of Vesālī </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, you should remember the householder Ugga of Vesālī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible qualities.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of Vesālī, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Ugga of Vesālī went up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to one side. The mendicant said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, the Buddha declared that you have eight amazing and incredible qualities. What are the eight qualities that he spoke of?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I don’t know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was referring to. But these eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, householder,” replied the mendicant. Ugga of Vesālī said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, when I first saw the Buddha off in the distance, my heart was inspired as soon as I saw him. This is the first incredible and amazing quality found in me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">With confident heart I paid homage to the Buddha. The Buddha taught me step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that my mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, joyful, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in me: ‘Everything that has a beginning has an end.’ I saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. I went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. Right there I went for refuge to the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha. And I undertook the five training rules with celibacy as the fifth. This is the second incredible and amazing quality found in me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I had four teenage wives. And I went to them and said: ‘Sisters, I’ve undertaken the five training rules with celibacy as fifth. If you wish, you may stay here, enjoy my wealth, and do good deeds. Or you can return to your own families. Or would you prefer if I gave you to another man?’ When I said this, my eldest wife said to me: ‘My lord, please give me to such-and-such a man.’ Then I summoned that man. Taking my wife with my left hand and a ceremonial vase with my right, I presented her to that man with the pouring of water. But I can’t recall getting upset while giving away my teenage wife. This is the third incredible and amazing quality found in me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And though my family has wealth, it’s shared without reserve with ethical people of good character. This is the fourth incredible and amazing quality found in me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When I pay homage to a mendicant, I do so carefully, not carelessly. This is the fifth incredible and amazing quality found in me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If that venerable teaches me the Dhamma, I listen carefully, not carelessly. But if they don’t teach me the Dhamma, I teach them. This is the sixth incredible and amazing quality found in me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s not unusual for deities to come to me and announce: ‘Householder, the Buddha’s teaching is well explained!’ When they say this I say to them: ‘The Buddha’s teaching is well explained, regardless of whether or not you deities say so!’ But I don’t recall getting too excited by the fact that the deities come to me, and I have a conversation with them. This is the seventh incredible and amazing quality found in me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha, I don’t see any that I haven’t given up. This is the eighth incredible and amazing quality found in me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me. But I don’t know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was referring to.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that mendicant, after taking alms-food in Ugga of Vesālī’s home, got up from his seat and left. Then after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the householder Ugga of Vesālī. The Buddha said:</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Hatthaka, you have a large congregation. How do you bring together such a large congregation?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I bring together such a large congregation by using the four ways of being inclusive as taught by the Buddha. When I know that a person can be included by a gift, I include them by giving a gift. When I know that a person can be included by kindly words, I include them by kindly words. When I know that a person can be included by taking care of them, I include them by caring for them. When I know that a person can be included by equality, I include them by treating them equally. But also, sir, my family is wealthy. They wouldn’t think that a poor person was worth listening to in the same way.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Hatthaka! This is the right way to bring together a large congregation. Whether in the past, future, or present, all those who have brought together a large congregation have done so by using these four ways of being inclusive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Hatthaka of Āḷavī with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. Then, not long after Hatthaka had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, you should remember the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible qualities. What eight? He’s faithful, ethical, conscientious, prudent, learned, generous, wise, and has few wishes. You should remember the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has these eight amazing and incredible qualities.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.25 : With Mahānāma </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, how is a lay follower defined?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mahānāma, when you’ve gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, you’re considered to be a lay follower.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But how is an ethical lay follower defined?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When a lay follower doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence, they’re considered to be an ethical lay follower.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But how do we define a lay follower who is practicing to benefit themselves, not others?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“A lay follower is accomplished in faith, but doesn’t encourage others to do the same. They’re accomplished in ethical conduct, but don’t encourage others to do the same. They’re accomplished in generosity, but don’t encourage others to do the same. They like to see the mendicants, but don’t encourage others to do the same. They like to hear the true teaching, but don’t encourage others to do the same. They readily memorize the teachings they’ve heard, but don’t encourage others to do the same. They examine the meaning of the teachings they’ve memorized, but don’t encourage others to do the same. Understanding the meaning and the teaching, they practice accordingly, but they don’t encourage others to do the same.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.27 : Powers (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these eight powers. What eight? Crying is the power of babies. Anger is the power of females. Weapons are the power of bandits.

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, a mendicant who has ended the defilements has eight powers that qualify them to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What eight? Firstly, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with right wisdom all conditions as truly impermanent. This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with right wisdom that sensual pleasures are truly like a pit of glowing coals. This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the mind of a mendicant with defilements ended slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion. They’re withdrawn, loving renunciation, and they’ve totally done with defiling influences. This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the four bases of psychic power … the five faculties … the seven awakening factors … the noble eightfold path.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.29 : Lost Opportunities </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Now is the time! Now is the time!’ So says an uneducated ordinary person. But they don’t know whether it’s time or not. Mendicants, there are eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice. What eight?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, a Realized One has arisen in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He teaches the Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the Holy One. But a person has been reborn in hell. This is the first lost opportunity for spiritual practice.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has been reborn in the animal realm. This is the second lost opportunity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has been reborn in the ghost realm. This is the third lost opportunity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has been reborn in one of the long-lived orders of gods. This is the fourth lost opportunity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has been reborn in the borderlands, among strange barbarian tribes, where monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen do not go. This is the fifth lost opportunity …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. And a person is reborn in a central country. But they have wrong view and distorted perspective: ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’ This is the sixth lost opportunity …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. And a person is reborn in a central country. But they’re witless, dull, stupid, and unable to distinguish what is well said from what is poorly said. This is the seventh lost opportunity …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a Realized One has not arisen in the world … So he doesn’t teach the Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the Holy One. And a person is reborn in a central country. And they’re wise, bright, clever, and able to distinguish what is well said from what is poorly said. This is the eighth lost opportunity …</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are these eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mendicants, there is just one opportunity for spiritual practice. What is that one? It’s when a Realized One has arisen in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He teaches the Dhamma leading to peace, extinguishment, awakening, as proclaimed by the Holy One. And a person is reborn in a central country. And they’re wise, bright, clever, and able to distinguish what is well said from what is poorly said. This is the one opportunity for spiritual practice.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.30 : Anuruddha and the Great Thoughts </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. And at that time Venerable Anuruddha was staying in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park. Then as Anuruddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes. It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment. It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company. It’s for the energetic, not the lazy. It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful. It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion. It’s for the wise, not the witless.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha knew what Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Anurruddha in the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs, and sat on the seat spread out. Anuruddha bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Anuruddha! It’s good that you reflect on these thoughts of a great man: ‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes. It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment. It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company. It’s for the energetic, not the lazy. It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful. It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion. It’s for the wise, not the witless.’ Well then, Anuruddha, you should also reflect on the following eighth thought of a great man: ‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">First you’ll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man. Then whenever you want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, you’ll enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You’ll enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You’ll enter and remain in the third absorption, where you’ll meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, you’ll enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">First you’ll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man, and you’ll get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when you want, without trouble or difficulty. Then as you live contented your rag robe will seem to you like a chest full of garments of different colors seems to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As you live contented your scraps of alms-food will seem to you like boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces seems to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to you like a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered seems to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to you like a couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends seems to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As you live contented your fermented urine as medicine will seem to you like various medicines—ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt—seem to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. Well then, Anuruddha, for the next rainy season residence you should stay right here in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Anuruddha replied.</p>
<p class="bodytext">After advising Anuruddha like this, the Buddha—as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs and reappeared in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas. He sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, I will teach you the eight thoughts of a great man. Listen …</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the eight thoughts of a great man? This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes. It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment. It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company. It’s for the energetic, not the lazy. It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful. It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion. It’s for the wise, not the witless. It’s for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? A mendicant with few wishes doesn’t wish: ‘May they know me as having few wishes!’ When contented, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as contented!’ When secluded, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as secluded!’ When energetic, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as energetic!’ When mindful, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as mindful!’ When immersed, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as immersed!’ When wise, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as wise!’ When not enjoying proliferation, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as one who doesn’t enjoy proliferating!’ ‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who’s content with any kind of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. ‘This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who lives secluded. But monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, rulers and their ministers, founders of religious sects, and their disciples go to visit them. With a mind slanting, sloping, and inclining to seclusion, withdrawn, and loving renunciation, that mendicant invariably gives each of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissal. ‘This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. ‘This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who’s mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. ‘This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. ‘This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who’s wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. ‘This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant whose mind is eager, confident, settled, and decided regarding the cessation of proliferation. ‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Anuruddha stayed the next rainy season residence right there in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park. And Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Anuruddha became one of the perfected. And on the occasion of attaining perfection he recited these verses:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Knowing my thoughts, </p>
<p class="gatha">the supreme Teacher in the world </p>
<p class="gatha">came to me in a mind-made body, </p>
<p class="gatha">using his psychic power.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He taught me more </p>
<p class="gatha">than I had thought of. </p>
<p class="gatha">The Buddha who loves non-proliferation </p>
<p class="gatha">taught me non-proliferation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Understanding that teaching, </p>
<p class="gatha">I happily did his bidding. </p>
<p class="gatha">I’ve attained the three knowledges, </p>
<p class="gatha">and have fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.”</p></div>

It occurs to them: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders!’ They settle on that idea, concentrate on it and develop it. As they’ve settled for less and not developed further, their idea leads to rebirth there. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.41 : The Sabbath With Eight Factors, In Brief </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. And how should it be observed? It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ This is its first factor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. I, too, for this day and night will give up stealing. I’ll take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. I’ll keep myself clean by not thieving. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ This is its second factor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex. I, too, for this day and night will give up unchastity. I will be celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ This is its third factor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words. I, too, for this day and night will give up lying. I’ll speak the truth and stick to the truth. I’ll be honest and trustworthy, and won’t trick the world with my words.

I, too, for this day and night will eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ This is its sixth factor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows; and beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. I, too, for this day and night will give up dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows; and beautifying and adorning myself with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.

This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors. Why is that? Because human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods of the Four Great Kings. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months make up a year.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.44 : With Vāseṭṭha on the Sabbath </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then the layman Vāseṭṭha went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Vāseṭṭha, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and glorious and effective. … blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If my loved ones—relatives and kin—were to observe this sabbath with its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If all the aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers were to observe this sabbath with its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s so true, Vāseṭṭha! That’s so true, Vāseṭṭha! If all the aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers were to observe this sabbath with its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If the whole world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to observe this sabbath with its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If these great sal trees were to observe this sabbath with its eight factors, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness—if they were sentient. How much more then a human being!”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.45 : With Bojjhā on the Sabbath </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the laywoman Bojjhā went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Bojjhā, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. And how should it be observed?</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ This is its first factor. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up high and luxurious beds. They sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I, too, for this day and night will give up high and luxurious beds. I’ll sleep in a low place, either a small bed or a straw mat. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ This is its eighth factor. The observance of the sabbath with its eight factors in this way is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.</p>
<p class="bodytext">How much so? Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajjī, Malla, Ceti, Vaṅga, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrusena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven kinds of precious things. This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors. Why is that? Because human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods of the Four Great Kings. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months make up a year. The life span of the Gods of the Four Great Kings is five hundred of these divine years. It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods of the Four Great Kings. This is what I was referring to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">A hundred years in the human realm …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Two hundred years in the human realm …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Four hundred years in the human realm …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Eight hundred years in the human realm …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sixteen hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months make up a year. The life span of the gods who control the creations of others is sixteen thousand of these divine years. It’s possible that a woman or man who has observed the eight-factored sabbath will—when their body breaks up, after death—be reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others. This is what I was referring to when I said: ‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’</p>
<p class="gatha0">You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal, </p>
<p class="gatha">or lie, or drink alcohol. </p>
<p class="gatha">Be celibate, refraining from sex, </p>
<p class="gatha">and don’t eat at night, the wrong time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Not wearing garlands or applying perfumes, </p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.46 : Anuruddha and the Agreeable Deities </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Anuruddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. Then several deities of the Lovable Host went up to Venerable Anuruddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, Anuruddha, we are the deities called ‘Loveable’. We wield authority and control over three things. We can turn any color we want. We can get any voice that we want. We can get any pleasure that we want. We are the deities called ‘Loveable’. We wield authority and control over these three things.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Anuruddha thought, “If only these deities would all turn blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue!” Then those deities, knowing Anuruddha’s thought, all turned blue.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Anuruddha thought, “If only these deities would all turn yellow …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If only these gods would all turn red …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If only these gods would all turn white …” Then those deities, knowing Anuruddha’s thought, all turned white.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then one of those deities sang, one danced, and one snapped her fingers. Suppose there was a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. They’d sound graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating. In the same way the performance by those deities sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating. But Venerable Anuruddha averted his senses.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those deities, thinking “Master Anuruddha isn’t enjoying this,” vanished right there. Then in the late afternoon, Anuruddha came out of retreat and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“How many qualities do females have so that—when their body breaks up, after death—they are reborn in company with the Gods of the Lovable Host?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Anuruddha, when they have eight qualities females—when their body breaks up, after death—are reborn in company with the Gods of the Lovable Host. What eight?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take the case of a female whose mother and father give her to a husband wanting what’s best for her, out of kindness and compassion. She would get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She honors, respects, esteems, and venerates those her husband respects, such as mother and father, and ascetics and brahmins. And when they arrive she serves them with a seat and water.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She’s skilled and tireless in her husband’s household duties, such as knitting and sewing. She understands how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She knows what work her husband’s domestic bondservants, employees, and workers have completed, and what they’ve left incomplete. She knows who is sick, and who is fit or unwell. She distributes to each a fair portion of various foods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She ensures that any income her husband earns is guarded and protected, whether money, grain, silver, or gold. She doesn’t overspend, steal, waste, or lose it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She’s a lay follower who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She’s ethical. She doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She’s generous. She lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.</p>

Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Vesālī, where he stayed at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had her hair cut off and dressed in ocher robes. Together with several Sakyan ladies she set out for Vesālī. Traveling stage by stage, she arrived at Vesālī and went to the Great Wood, the hall with the peaked roof.

<p class="bodytext">“Enough, Ānanda. Don’t advocate for females to gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “The Buddha does not permit females to go forth. Why don’t I try another approach?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Sir, is a female able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“She is able, Ānanda.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If a female is able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth. Sir, Mahāpajāpatī has been very helpful to the Buddha. She is his aunt who raised him, nurtured him, and gave him her milk. When the Buddha’s birth mother passed away, she nurtured him at her own breast. Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these eight principles of respect, that will be her ordination.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow down to a monk who was ordained that very day. She should rise up for him, greet him with joined palms, and observe proper etiquette toward him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A nun should not commence the rainy season residence in a monastery without monks. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Each fortnight the nuns should expect two things from the community of monks: the date of the sabbath, and visiting for advice. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">After completing the rainy season residence the nuns should invite admonition from the communities of both monks and nuns in regard to anything that was seen, heard, or suspected. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A nun who has committed a grave offense should undergo penance in the communities of both monks and nuns for a fortnight. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years should seek ordination from the communities of both monks and nuns. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A nun should not abuse or insult a monk in any way. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these eight principles of respect, that will be her ordination.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Ānanda, having learned these eight principles of respect from the Buddha himself, went to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Gotamī, if you accept eight principles of respect, that will be your ordination.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow down to a monk who was ordained that very day. She should rise up for him, greet him with joined palms, and observe proper etiquette toward him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts. If you accept these eight principles of respect, that will be your ordination.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. After getting a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or liana flowers, they would take them in both hands and place them on the crown of the head. In the same way, sir, I accept these eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has accepted the eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, if females had not gained the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, the spiritual life would have lasted long. The true teaching would have remained for a thousand years. But since they have gained the going forth, now the spiritual life will not last long. The true teaching will remain only five hundred years.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s like those families with many women and few men. They’re easy prey for bandits and thieves. In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s like a field full of rice. Once the disease called ‘white bones’ attacks, it doesn’t last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s like a field full of sugar cane. Once the disease called ‘red rot’ attacks, it doesn’t last long. In the same way, the spiritual life does not last long in a teaching and training where females gain the going forth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As a man might build a dyke around a large lake as a precaution against the water overflowing, in the same way as a precaution I’ve prescribed the eight principles of respect as not to be transgressed so long as life lasts.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, how many qualities should a monk have to be agreed on as an adviser for nuns?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, a monk with eight qualities may be agreed on as an adviser for nuns. What eight?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, a monk is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, with good behavior and supporters. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and understanding them with right view.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Both monastic codes have been passed down to them in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well judged in both the rules and accompanying material.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re a good speaker. Their voice is polished, clear, articulate, and expresses the meaning.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re able to educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire the community of nuns.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re likable and agreeable to most of the nuns.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have never previously sexually harassed any woman wearing the ocher robe who has gone forth in the Buddha’s name.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have been ordained for twenty years or more.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Gotamī, you might know that certain things lead to passion, not dispassion; to being fettered, not to being unfettered; to accumulation, not dispersal; to more desires, not fewer; to lack of contentment, not contentment; to crowding, not seclusion; to laziness, not energy; to being hard to look after, not being easy to look after. You should definitely bear in mind that these things are not the teaching, not the training, and not the Teacher’s instructions.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Kakkarapatta. Then Dīghajāṇu the Koliyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures and living at home with our children. We use sandalwood imported from Kāsi, we wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and we accept gold and money. May the Buddha please teach us the Dhamma in a way that leads to our welfare and happiness in this life and in future lives.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Byagghapajja, these four things lead to the welfare and happiness of a gentleman in this life. What four?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced finances. And what is accomplishment in initiative? It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. They understand how to go about these things in order to complete and organize the work. This is called accomplishment in initiative.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in protection? It’s when a gentleman owns legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. They ensure it is guarded and protected, thinking: ‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ This is called accomplishment in protection.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in good friendship? It’s when a gentleman resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct, accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. That person associates with them, converses, and engages in discussion. And they emulate the same kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. This is called accomplishment in good friendship.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in balanced finances? It’s when a gentleman, knowing their income and expenditure, balances their finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. They think: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’ It’s like an appraiser or their apprentice who, holding up the scales, knows that it’s low by this much or high by this much. In the same way, a gentleman, knowing their income and expenditure, balances their finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. They think: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’ If a gentleman has little income but an opulent life, people will say: ‘This gentleman eats their wealth like a fig-eater!’ If a gentleman has a large income but a spartan life, people will say: ‘This gentleman is starving themselves to death!’ But a gentleman, knowing their income and expenditure, leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, thinking: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’ This is called accomplishment in balanced finances.</p>

But material possessions don’t come to them. And so they sorrow and pine and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion because they don’t get those material possessions. This is called a mendicant who lives desiring material possessions. They try hard, strive, and make an effort to get them. But when possessions don’t come to them, they sorrow and lament. They’ve fallen from the true teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Next, when a mendicant stays secluded, living independently, a desire arises for material possessions. They try hard, strive, and make an effort to get them. And material possessions do come to them. And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding those material possessions. This is called a mendicant who lives desiring material possessions. They try hard, strive, and make an effort to get them. And when possessions come to them, they become intoxicated and negligent. They’ve fallen from the true teaching.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.63 : A Teaching in Brief </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This is exactly how some foolish people ask me for something. But when the teaching has been explained they think only of following me around.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, may the Buddha teach me the Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicant, you should train like this: ‘My mind will be steady and well settled internally. And bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen will not occupy my mind.’ That’s how you should train.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When your mind is steady and well settled internally, and bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen don’t occupy your mind, then you should train like this: ‘I will develop the heart’s release by love.

<p class="bodytext">When that mendicant had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And that mendicant became one of the perfected.</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.64 : At Gāyā Head </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Gāyā on Gāyā Head. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still not awake but intent on awakening—I perceived light but did not see visions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me, ‘What if I were to both perceive light and see visions? Then my knowledge and vision would become even more purified.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So after some time, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, I perceived light and saw visions. But I didn’t associate with those deities, converse, or engage in discussion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me, ‘What if I were to perceive light and see visions; and associate with those deities, converse, and engage in discussion? Then my knowledge and vision would become even more purified.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So after some time … I perceived light and saw visions. And I associated with those deities, conversed, and engaged in discussion. But I didn’t know which orders of gods those deities came from.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me, ‘What if I were to perceive light and see visions; and associate with those deities, converse, and engage in discussion; and find out which orders of gods those deities come from? Then my knowledge and vision would become even more purified.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So after some time … I perceived light and saw visions. And I associated with those deities … And I found out which orders of gods those deities came from. But I didn’t know what deeds caused those deities to be reborn there after passing away from here.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So after some time … I found out what deeds caused those deities to be reborn there after passing away from here. But I didn’t know what deeds caused those deities to have such food and such an experience of pleasure and pain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So after some time … I found out what deeds caused those deities to have such food and such an experience of pleasure and pain. But I didn’t know that these deities have a life-span of such a length.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So after some time … I found out that these deities have a life-span of such a length. But I didn’t know whether or not I had previously lived together with those deities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me, ‘What if I were to perceive light and see visions; and associate with those deities, converse, and engage in discussion; and find out which orders of gods those deities come from; and what deeds caused those deities to be reborn there after passing away from here; and what deeds caused those deities to have such food and such an experience of pleasure and pain; and that these deities have a life-span of such a length; and whether or not I have previously lived together with those deities. Then my knowledge and vision would become even more purified.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So after some time … I found out whether or not I have previously lived together with those deities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As long as my knowledge and vision about the deities was not fully purified from these eight perspectives, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But when my knowledge and vision about the deities was fully purified from these eight perspectives, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. Knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there are no more future lives.’”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.65 : Dimensions of Mastery </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these eight dimensions of mastery. What eight?</p>

<p class="bodytext">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’ This is the fifth dimension of mastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint. Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’ This is the sixth dimension of mastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, red, with red color, red hue, and red tint. Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’ This is the seventh dimension of mastery.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these eight liberations. What eight? Having physical form, they see visions. This is the first liberation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Not perceiving form internally, they see visions externally. This is the second liberation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re focused only on beauty. This is the third liberation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. This is the fourth liberation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is the fifth liberation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. This is the sixth liberation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the seventh liberation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is the eighth liberation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the eight liberations.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.67 : Ignoble Expressions </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these eight ignoble expressions. What eight? Saying you’ve seen, heard, thought, or known something, but you haven’t. And saying you haven’t seen, heard, thought, or known something, and you have. These are the eight ignoble expressions.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of aristocrats. There I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion. And my appearance and voice became just like theirs. I educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. But when I spoke they didn’t know: ‘Who is this that speaks? Is it a god or a human?’ And when my Dhamma talk was finished I vanished. But when I vanished they didn’t know: ‘Who was that who vanished? Was it a god or a human?’</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.70 : Earthquakes </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, get your sitting cloth. Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out. When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time …</p>
<p class="bodytext">And for a third time, the Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.

<p class="bodytext">But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, “Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings; not until they practice appropriately, living in line with the teaching; not until they’ve learned their tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, open, analyze, and make it clear; not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ Today you do have such monk disciples.</p>
<p class="bodytext">May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … Today you do have such laywoman disciples.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. Sir, you once made this statement:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So at the Cāpāla tree shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force. When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha was inspired to exclaim:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Weighing up the incomparable against an extension of life, </p>
<p class="gatha">the sage surrendered the life force. </p>
<p class="gatha">Happy inside, serene, </p>
<p class="gatha">he burst out of this self-made chain like a suit of armor.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “That was a really big earthquake! That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky! What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, that was a really big earthquake! That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky! What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, there are these eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake. What eight?</p>
<p class="bodytext">This great earth is grounded on water, the water is grounded on air, and the air stands in space. At a time when a great wind blows, it stirs the water, and the water stirs the earth. This is the first cause and reason for a great earthquake.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, there is an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind, or a god who is mighty and powerful. They’ve developed a limited perception of earth and a limitless perception of water. They make the earth shake and rock and tremble. This is the second cause and reason for a great earthquake.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of Joyful Gods, he’s conceived in his mother’s belly, mindful and aware. Then the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the third cause and reason for a great earthquake.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening comes out of his mother’s belly mindful and aware, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the fourth cause and reason for a great earthquake.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, when the Realized One realizes the supreme perfect awakening, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the fifth cause and reason for a great earthquake.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.73 : Mindfulness of Death (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless. But do you develop mindfulness of death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, “Sir, I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live for another day and night, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another mendicant said to the Buddha, “Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Another mendicant said to the Buddha, “Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to eat a meal of alms-food, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another mendicant said to the Buddha, “Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another mendicant said to the Buddha, “Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">When this was said, the Buddha said to those mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing to live for a day and night … or to live for a day … or to live for half a day … or to live as long as it takes to eat a meal of alms-food … or to live as long as it takes to eat half a meal of alms-food … or to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls … These are called mendicants who live negligently. They slackly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful … or to live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out … These are called mendicants who live diligently. They keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this: ‘We will live diligently. We will keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.’ That’s how you should train.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.74 : Mindfulness of Death (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is mindfulness of death developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial, to culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless? As day passes by and night draws close, a mendicant reflects: ‘I might die of many causes. A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or centipede might sting me. And if I died from that it would be an obstacle to me. Or I might stumble off a cliff, or get food poisoning, or suffer a disturbance of bile, phlegm, or piercing winds. Or I might be attacked by humans or non-humans. And if I died from that it would be an obstacle to me.’ That mendicant should reflect: ‘Are there any bad, unskillful qualities that I haven’t given up, which might be an obstacle to me if I die tonight?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are such bad, unskillful qualities. Then in order to give them up they should apply outstanding enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it, you’d apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness. In the same way, in order to give up those bad, unskillful qualities, that mendicant should apply outstanding enthusiasm …</p>
<p class="bodytext">But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are no such bad, unskillful qualities. Then that mendicant should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.76 : Accomplishments (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these eight accomplishments. What eight? Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced finances. And accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in initiative? It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. They understand how to go about these things in order to complete and organize the work. This is called accomplishment in initiative.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in protection? It’s when a gentleman owns legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. They ensure it is guarded and protected, thinking: ‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ This is called accomplishment in protection.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in good friendship? It’s when a gentleman resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct, accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. They associate with them, converse and engage in discussion. And they emulate the same kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. This is called accomplishment in good friendship.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in balanced finances? It’s when a gentleman, knowing their income and expenditure, balances their finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. They think: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’ It’s like an appraiser or their apprentice who, holding up the scales, knows that it’s low by this much or high by this much. In the same way, a gentleman, knowing their income and expenditure, balances their finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. They think: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’ If a gentleman has little income but an opulent life, people will say: ‘This gentleman eats their wealth like a fig-eater!’ If a gentleman has a large income but a spartan life, people will say: ‘This gentleman is starving themselves to death!’ But a gentleman, knowing their income and expenditure, leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, thinking: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’ This is called accomplishment in balanced finances.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in faith? It’s when a gentleman has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ This is called accomplishment in faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in ethics? It’s when a gentleman doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. This is called accomplishment in ethics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in generosity? It’s when a gentleman lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. This is called accomplishment in generosity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is accomplishment in wisdom? It’s when a gentleman is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is called accomplishment in wisdom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the eight accomplishments.</p>
<p class="gatha0">They’re enterprising in the workplace, </p>
<p class="gatha">diligent in managing things, </p>

<p class="bodytext">There are eight grounds for arousing energy. What eight? Firstly, a mendicant has some work to do. They think: ‘I have some work to do. While working it’s not easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.’ They rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This is the first ground for arousing energy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant has done some work. They think: ‘I’ve done some work. While I was working I wasn’t able to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.’ They rouse up energy … This is the second ground for arousing energy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant has to go on a journey. They think: ‘I have to go on a journey. While walking it’s not easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy …’ … This is the third ground for arousing energy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant has gone on a journey. They think: ‘I’ve gone on a journey. While I was walking I wasn’t able to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy …’ … This is the fourth ground for arousing energy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, but they didn’t get to fill up on as much food as they like, coarse or fine. They think: ‘I’ve wandered for alms, but I didn’t get to fill up on as much food as I like, coarse or fine. My body is light and fit for work. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy …’ … This is the fifth ground for arousing energy.</p>

I’d better preemptively rouse up energy …’ … This is the sixth ground for arousing energy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant feels a little sick. They think: ‘I feel a little sick. It’s possible this illness will worsen. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy …’ … This is the seventh ground for arousing energy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant has recently recovered from illness. They think: ‘I’ve recently recovered from illness. It’s possible the illness will come back. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.’ They rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.82 : With Puṇṇiya </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Puṇṇiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason why sometimes the Realized One feels inspired to teach, and other times not?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Puṇṇiya, when a mendicant has faith but doesn’t approach, the Realized One doesn’t feel inspired to teach. But when a mendicant has faith and approaches, the Realized One feels inspired to teach. When a mendicant has faith and approaches, but doesn’t pay homage … they pay homage, but don’t ask questions … they ask questions, but don’t lend an ear … they lend an ear, but don’t remember the teaching they’ve heard … they remember the teaching they’ve heard, but don’t reflect on the meaning of the teachings they’ve remembered … they reflect on the meaning of the teachings they’ve remembered, but, having understood the meaning and the teaching, they don’t practice accordingly. The Realized One doesn’t feel inspired to teach.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But when a mendicant has faith, approaches, pays homage, asks questions, lends an ear, remembers the teachings, reflects on the meaning, and practices accordingly, the Realized One feels inspired to teach.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.83 : Rooted </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, if wanderers who follow other paths were to ask: ‘Reverends, all things have what as their root? What produces them? What is their origin? What is their meeting place? What is their chief? What is their ruler? What is their overseer? What is their core?’ How would you answer them?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicants, I will teach it. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

What is their meeting place? What is their chief? What is their ruler? What is their overseer? What is their core?’ You should answer them: ‘Reverends, all things are rooted in desire.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 8.86 : With Nāgita </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ … It’s good to see such perfected ones.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, when the night had passed, they took many different foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant. Then the Buddha said to Nāgita, “Nāgita, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many different foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me. There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent! Now is the time for the Buddha to relent. Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill. In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. Why is that? Because of the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Even some of the deities can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. When you all come together to enjoy each other’s company, I think: ‘These venerables mustn’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. That must be because they come together to enjoy each other’s company.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">Take a mendicant living in the neighborhood of a village who I see sitting immersed in samādhi.

<p class="bodytext">Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting nodding in meditation.

<p class="bodytext">Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting without being immersed in samādhi.

Enjoying possessions, honor, and popularity they neglect retreat, and they neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. They come down to villages, towns and capital cities and make their homes there. So I’m not pleased that that mendicant is living in the neighborhood of a village.</p>
