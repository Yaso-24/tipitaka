<p class="title">1. Worthy of Offerings</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.1 : Worthy of Offerings (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant with six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What six?</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s a mendicant who, when they see a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they hear a sound with their ears …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they smell an odor with their nose …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they taste a flavor with their tongue …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they feel a touch with their body …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they know a thought with their mind, they’re neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant with these six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.2 : Worthy of Offerings (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant with six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What six?</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. They understand mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … mind immersed in samādhi … mind not immersed in samādhi … freed mind … They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.</p>
<p class="bodytext">With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant with these six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.3 : Faculties </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant with six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What six? The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. A mendicant with these six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.5 : The Thoroughbred (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a fine royal thoroughbred with six factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What six? It’s when a fine royal thoroughbred can endure sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. And it’s beautiful. A fine royal thoroughbred with these six factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.8 : Unsurpassable </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, these six things are unsurpassable. What six? The unsurpassable seeing, listening, acquisition, training, service, and recollection. These are the six unsurpassable things.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.9 : Topics for Recollection </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these six topics for recollection. What six? The recollection of the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, ethics, generosity, and the deities. These are the six topics for recollection.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.10 : With Mahānāma </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, when a noble disciple has reached the fruit and understood the instructions, what kind of meditation do they frequently practice?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mahānāma, when a noble disciple has reached the fruit and understood the instructions they frequently practice this kind of meditation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, a noble disciple recollects the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the Realized One. A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds joy in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching. When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ When a noble disciple recollects the teaching their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of the teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own ethical conduct, which is unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. When a noble disciple recollects their ethical conduct their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of ethics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own generosity: ‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate! Among people full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’ When a noble disciple recollects their own generosity their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of generosity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the deities: ‘There are the Gods of the Four Great Kings, the Gods of the Thirty-Three, the Gods of Yama, the Joyful Gods, the Gods Who Love to Create, the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, the Gods of Brahmā’s Host, and gods even higher than these. When those deities passed away from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’ When a noble disciple recollects the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and the deities their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the deities. A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds joy in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching. When you’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, you feel bliss. And when you’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of the deities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple has reached the fruit and understood the instructions this is the kind of meditation they frequently practice.”</p></div>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.13 : Elements of Escape </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these six elements of escape. What six?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take a mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by love. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow ill will still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! Don’t say that. Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. It’s impossible, reverend, it cannot happen that the heart’s release by love has been developed and properly implemented, yet somehow ill will still occupies the mind. For it is the heart’s release by love that is the escape from ill will.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by compassion. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow the thought of harming still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the heart’s release by compassion that is the escape from thoughts of harming.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by rejoicing. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow negativity still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the heart’s release by rejoicing that is the escape from negativity.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by equanimity. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow desire still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the heart’s release by equanimity that is the escape from desire.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the signless release of the heart. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow my consciousness still follows after signs.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the signless release of the heart that is the escape from all signs.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’m rid of the conceit “I am”. And I don’t regard anything as “I am this”. Yet somehow the dart of doubt and indecision still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! Don’t say that. Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. It’s impossible, reverend, it cannot happen that the conceit “I am” has been done away with, and nothing is regarded as “I am this”, yet somehow the dart of doubt and indecision still occupies the mind. For it is the uprooting of the conceit “I am” that is the escape from the dart of doubt and indecision.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the six elements of escape.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.14 : A Good Death </h3>
<p class="bodytext">There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“A mendicant lives life so as to not have a good death. And how do they live life so as to not have a good death?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take a mendicant who relishes work, talk, sleep, company, closeness, and proliferation. They love these things and like to relish them. A mendicant who lives life like this does not have a good death. This is called a mendicant who enjoys identity, who hasn’t given up identity to rightly make an end of suffering.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.16 : Nakula’s Father </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. Now at that time the householder Nakula’s father was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then the housewife Nakula’s mother said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, don’t pass away with concerns. Such concern is suffering, and it’s criticized by the Buddha. Householder, you might think: ‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother won’t be able to provide for the children and keep up the household carpets.’ But you should not see it like this. I’m skilled at spinning cotton and carding wool. I’m able to provide for the children and keep up the household carpets. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Householder, you might think: ‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother will take another husband.’ But you should not see it like this. Both you and I know that we have remained celibate while at home for the past sixteen years. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Householder, you might think: ‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother won’t want to see the Buddha and his Saṅgha of mendicants.’ But you should not see it like this. When you’ve gone, I’ll want to see the Buddha and his mendicant Saṅgha even more. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Householder, you might think: ‘The housewife Nakula’s mother won’t fulfill ethics.’ But you should not see it like this. I am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who fulfills their ethics. Whoever doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Householder, you might think: ‘The housewife Nakula’s mother doesn’t have internal serenity of heart.’ But you should not see it like this. I am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has internal serenity of heart. Whoever doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Householder, you might think: ‘The housewife Nakula’s mother has not gained a basis, a firm basis, and solace in this teaching and training. She has not gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained assurance. And she’s not independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions.’ But you should not see it like this. I am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has gained a basis, a firm basis, and solace in this teaching and training. I have gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained assurance. And I am independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions. Whoever doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns. Such concern is suffering, and it’s criticized by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then, as Nakula’s mother was giving this advice to Nakula’s father, his illness died down on the spot. And that’s how Nakula’s father recovered from that illness. Soon after recovering, leaning on a staff he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to have the housewife Nakula’s mother advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She is one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who fulfills their ethics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She is one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has internal serenity of heart.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She is one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has gained a basis, a firm basis, and solace in this teaching and training. She has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained assurance. And she is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to have the housewife Nakula’s mother advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.17 : Sleep </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, and sat down on the seat spread out. Venerable Sāriputta also came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. Venerables Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahācunda, Mahākappina, Anuruddha, Revata, and Ānanda did the same. The Buddha spent most of the night sitting meditation, then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. And soon after the Buddha left those venerables each went to their own dwelling.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But those mendicants who were junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training slept until the sun came up, snoring. The Buddha saw them doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman. He went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, where is Sāriputta? Where are Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahācunda, Mahākappina, Anuruddha, Revata, and Ānanda? Where have these senior disciples gone?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Soon after the Buddha left those venerables each went to their own dwelling.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So, mendicants, when the senior mendicants left, why did you sleep until the sun came up, snoring?</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of an anointed king who rules his whole life, dear and beloved to the country, while indulging in the pleasures of sleeping, lying, and drowsing as much as he likes?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of an appointed official … a hereditary official … a general … a village chief … or a guild head who runs the guild his whole life, dear and beloved to the guild, while indulging in the pleasures of sleeping, lying, and drowsing as much as he likes?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of an ascetic or brahmin who indulges in the pleasures of sleeping, lying, and drowsing as much as they like? Their sense doors are unguarded, they eat too much, they’re not dedicated to wakefulness, they’re unable to discern skillful qualities, and they don’t pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Yet they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this: ‘We will guard our sense doors, eat in moderation, be dedicated to wakefulness, discern skillful qualities, and pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn.’ That’s how you should train.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.18 : A Fish Dealer </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">While walking along the road he saw a fish dealer in a certain spot selling fish that he had killed himself. Seeing this he left the road, sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants, do you see that fish dealer selling fish that he killed himself?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a fish dealer selling fish that he killed himself who, by means of that work and livelihood, got to travel by elephant, horse, chariot, or vehicle, or to enjoy wealth, or to live off a large fortune?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. Why is that? Because when the fish are brought for the slaughter he regards them with bad intentions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a butcher of cattle selling cattle that he killed himself who, by means of that work and livelihood, got to travel by elephant, horse, chariot, or vehicle, or to enjoy wealth, or to live off a large fortune?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. Why is that? Because when the cattle are brought for the slaughter he regards them with bad intentions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of a butcher of sheep … a butcher of pigs … a butcher of poultry … or a deer-hunter selling deer which he killed himself who, by means of that work and livelihood, got to travel by elephant, horse, chariot, or vehicle, or to enjoy wealth, or to live off a large fortune?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. Why is that? Because when the deer are brought for the slaughter he regards them with bad intentions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">By regarding even animals brought for the slaughter with bad intentions you don’t get to travel by elephant, horse, chariot, or vehicle, or to enjoy wealth, or to live off a large fortune. How much worse is someone who regards human beings brought to the slaughter with bad intentions! This will be for their lasting harm and suffering. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.19 : Mindfulness of Death (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless. But do you develop mindfulness of death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, “Sir, I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live for another day and night, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another mendicant said to the Buddha, “Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live for another day, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another mendicant said to the Buddha, “Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to eat a meal of alms-food, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another mendicant said to the Buddha, “Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another mendicant said to the Buddha, “Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another mendicant said to the Buddha, “Sir, I too develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you develop it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In this case, sir, I think: ‘Oh, if I’d only live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, I’d focus on the Buddha’s instructions and I could really achieve a lot.’ That’s how I develop mindfulness of death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, the Buddha said to those mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“As to the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing to live for a day and night …  or to live for a day …  or to live as long as it takes to eat a meal of alms-food …  or to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls— these are called mendicants who live negligently. They slackly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But as to the mendicants who develop mindfulness of death by wishing to live as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful …  or to live as long as it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out— these are called mendicants who live diligently. They keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this: ‘We will live diligently. We will keenly develop mindfulness of death for the ending of defilements.’ That’s how you should train.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.20 : Mindfulness of Death (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:</p>

And how is mindfulness of death developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial, to culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless?</p>
<p class="bodytext">As day passes by and night draws close, a mendicant reflects: ‘I might die of many causes. A snake might bite me, or a scorpion or centipede might sting me. And if I died from that it would be an obstacle to me. Or I might stumble off a cliff, or get food poisoning, or suffer a disturbance of bile, phlegm, or piercing winds. And if I died from that it would be an obstacle to me.’ That mendicant should reflect: ‘Are there any bad, unskillful qualities that I haven’t given up, which might be an obstacle to me if I die tonight?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are such bad, unskillful qualities. Then in order to give them up they should apply outstanding enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness. Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it, you’d apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness. In the same way, in order to give up those bad, unskillful qualities, that mendicant should apply outstanding enthusiasm …</p>
<p class="bodytext">But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that there are no such bad, unskillful qualities. Then that mendicant should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans near the little village of Sāma, by a lotus pond.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire lotus pond, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, three qualities lead to the decline of a mendicant. What three? Relishing work, talk, and sleep. These three qualities lead to the decline of a mendicant.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s what that deity said, and the teacher approved. Then that deity, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened, adding:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s unfortunate for those of you who even the deities know are declining in skillful qualities. I will teach you three more qualities that lead to decline. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what, mendicants, are three qualities that lead to decline? Enjoyment of company, being hard to admonish, and having bad friends. These three qualities lead to decline.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whether in the past, future, or present, all those who decline in skillful qualities do so because of these six qualities.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.22 : Non-decline </h3>

At that time their mind is unswerving. They’ve left behind greed; they’re free of it and have risen above it. ‘Greed’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation. Relying on this some sentient beings are purified.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own ethical precepts, which are unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.

<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own generosity: ‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate! Among people full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’ When a noble disciple recollects their generosity their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. …</p>

<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, there’s a time when a mendicant’s heart is overcome and mired in ill will … dullness and drowsiness … restlessness and remorse … doubt …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, there’s a time when a mendicant doesn’t understand what kind of meditation they need to focus on in order to end the defilements in the present life. On that occasion they should go to an esteemed mendicant and say, “I don’t understand what kind of meditation to focus on in order to end the defilements in the present life. Venerable, please teach me how to end the defilements.” Then that esteemed mendicant teaches them how to end the defilements. This is the sixth occasion for going to see an esteemed mendicant.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Reverends, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: ‘These are the six occasions for going to see an esteemed mendicant.’”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.29 : With Udāyī </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to Udāyī, “Udāyī, how many topics for recollection are there?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Udāyī kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And a second time … and a third time, the Buddha said to him, “Udāyī, how many topics for recollection are there?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And a second time and a third time Udāyī kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Udāyī, “Reverend Udāyī, the teacher is addressing you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Ānanda, I hear the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. This is a topic for recollection.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, I know that this silly man Udāyī is not committed to the higher mind. Ānanda, how many topics for recollection are there?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, there are five topics for recollection. What five?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption. When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to blissful meditation in this very life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day regardless of whether it is night or day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to knowledge and vision.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to giving up sensual desire.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Or suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews … A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews … A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews … Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull … White bones, the color of shells … Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile … Bones rotted and crumbled to powder. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to uprooting the conceit ‘I am’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to the penetration of many elements. These are the five topics for recollection.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Ānanda. Well then, Ānanda, you should also remember this sixth topic for recollection. In this case, a mendicant goes out mindfully, returns mindfully, stands mindfully, sits mindfully, lies down mindfully, and applies themselves to work mindfully. When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to mindfulness and situational awareness.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.30 : Unsurpassable </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, these six things are unsurpassable. What six? The unsurpassable seeing, listening, acquisition, training, service, and recollection.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the unsurpassable seeing? Some people go to see an elephant-treasure, a horse-treasure, a jewel-treasure, or a diverse spectrum of sights; or ascetics and brahmins of wrong view and wrong practice. There is such a seeing, I don’t deny it. That seeing is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. The unsurpassable seeing is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, goes to see a Realized One or their disciple. This is in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. This is called the unsurpassable seeing. Such is the unsurpassable seeing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But what of the unsurpassable hearing? Some people go to hear the sound of drums, arched harps, singing, or a diverse spectrum of sounds; or ascetics and brahmins of wrong view and wrong practice. There is such a hearing, I don’t deny it. That hearing … doesn’t lead to extinguishment. The unsurpassable hearing is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, goes to hear the teaching of a Realized One or one of his disciples. … This is called the unsurpassable hearing. Such is the unsurpassable seeing and hearing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But what of the unsurpassable acquisition? Some people acquire a child, a wife, wealth, or a diverse spectrum of things; or they acquire faith in an ascetic or brahmin of wrong view and wrong practice. There is such an acquisition, I don’t deny it. That acquisition … doesn’t lead to extinguishment. The unsurpassable acquisition is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, acquires faith in a Realized One or their disciple. … This is called the unsurpassable acquisition. Such is the unsurpassable seeing, hearing, and acquisition.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But what of the unsurpassable training? Some people train in elephant riding, horse riding, chariot driving, archery, swordsmanship, or a diverse spectrum of things; or they train under an ascetic or brahmin of wrong view and wrong practice. There is such a training, I don’t deny it. That training … doesn’t lead to extinguishment. The unsurpassable training is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, trains in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One. … This is called the unsurpassable training. Such is the unsurpassable seeing, hearing, acquisition, and training.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But what of the unsurpassable service? Some people serve an aristocrat, a brahmin, a householder, or a diverse spectrum of people; or they serve ascetics and brahmins of wrong view and wrong practice. There is such service, I don’t deny it. That service … doesn’t lead to extinguishment. The unsurpassable service is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, serves a Realized One or their disciple. … This is called the unsurpassable service. Such is the unsurpassable seeing, listening, acquisition, training, and service.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But what of the unsurpassable recollection? Some people recollect a child, a wife, wealth, or a diverse spectrum of things; or they recollect an ascetic or brahmin of wrong view and wrong practice. There is such recollection, I don’t deny it. That recollection is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. The unsurpassable recollection is when someone with settled faith and love, sure and devoted, recollects a Realized One or their disciple. … This is called the unsurpassable recollection.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the six unsurpassable things.</p>
<p class="gatha0">They’ve gained the unsurpassed seeing, </p>
<p class="gatha">the unsurpassed hearing, </p>
<p class="gatha">and the unsurpassable acquisition. </p>
<p class="gatha">They enjoy the unsurpassable training</p>
<p class="bodytext">and serve with care. </p>
<p class="gatha">Then they develop recollection </p>
<p class="gatha">connected with seclusion, </p>
<p class="gatha">which is safe, and leads to the deathless.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They rejoice in diligence, </p>
<p class="gatha">alert and ethically restrained. </p>

<p class="bodytext">“These six things lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee. What six? They relish work, talk, sleep, and company. They don’t guard the sense doors, and they eat too much. These six things lead to the decline of a mendicant trainee.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.32 : Non-decline (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:</p>

<p class="bodytext">That’s what that deity said, and the teacher approved. Then that deity, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.34 : With Mahāmoggallāna </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then as Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “Which gods know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been reborn in a Brahmā realm. There they knew that Tissa the Brahmā was very mighty and powerful.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, and said to him, “Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good Moggallāna! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.” Moggallāna sat down on the seat spread out. Then Tissa bowed to Moggallāna and sat to one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Moggallāna said to him, “Tissa, which gods know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The gods of the Four Great Kings know this.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But do all of them know this?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them. Those who lack experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and lack the ethics loved by the noble ones, do not know that they are stream-enterers. But those who have experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have the ethics loved by the noble ones, do know that they are stream-enterers.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Tissa, is it only the gods of the Four Great Kings who know that they are stream-enterers, or do the gods of the Thirty Three … the Gods of Yama … the Joyful Gods … the Gods Who Love to Create … and the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The gods of these various classes know this.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Tissa the Brahmā said. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from that Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.35 : Things That Play a Part in Realization </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“These six things play a part in realization. What six? The perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering in impermanence, the perception of not-self in suffering, the perception of giving up, the perception of fading away, and the perception of cessation.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.36 : Roots of Quarrels </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these six roots of quarrels. What six? Firstly, a mendicant is irritable and hostile. Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training. They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans. If you see such a root of quarrels in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing. If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future. That’s how to give up this bad root of quarrels, so it doesn’t come up in the future.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is offensive and contemptuous … They’re jealous and stingy … devious and deceitful … with wicked desires and wrong view … They’re attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.37 : A Gift With Six Factors </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, was preparing a religious donation for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. The Buddha saw her doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, and he addressed the mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, is preparing a religious donation for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a religious donation have six factors? Three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What three factors apply to the donor? It’s when a donor is in a good mood before giving, while giving they feel confident, and after giving they’re uplifted. These three factors apply to the donor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What three factors apply to the recipients? It’s when the recipients are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them. These three factors apply to the recipients.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Thus three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients. That’s how a religious donation has six factors.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s not easy to grasp the merit of such an offering by saying that this is the extent of their overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurtures happiness and is conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. And it leads to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are. It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water. In the same way, it’s not easy to grasp the merit of such an offering …</p>
<p class="gatha0">A good mood before giving, </p>
<p class="gatha">confidence while giving, </p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.38 : One’s Own Volition </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, this is my doctrine and view: One does not act of one’s own volition, nor does one act of another’s volition.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, brahmin, I’ve never seen or heard of anyone holding such a doctrine or view. How on earth can someone who comes and goes on his own say that one does not act of one’s own volition, nor does one act of another’s volition?</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, brahmin, is there an element of initiative?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Since this is so, do we find sentient beings who initiate activity?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Since there is an element of initiative, and sentient beings who initiate activity are found, sentient beings act of their own volition or that of another.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, brahmin, is there an element of persistence … exertion … strength … persistence … energy?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Since this is so, do we find sentient beings who have energy?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>

Rather, delusion just gives rise to delusion. It’s not because of deeds born of greed, hate, and delusion that gods, humans, or those in any other good places are found. Rather, it’s because of deeds born of greed, hate, and delusion that hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, or any other bad places are found. These are three sources that give rise to deeds.</p>

<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood. Then Venerable Kimbila went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.41 : A Tree Trunk </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, descended the Vulture’s Peak together with several mendicants. At a certain spot he saw a large tree trunk, and he addressed the mendicants, “Reverends, do you see this large tree trunk?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If they wanted to, a mendicant with psychic powers who has mastered their mind could determine this tree trunk to be nothing but earth. Why is that? Because the earth element exists in the tree trunk. Relying on that a mendicant with psychic powers could determine it to be nothing but earth. If they wanted to, a mendicant with psychic powers who has mastered their mind could determine this tree trunk to be nothing but water. … Or they could determine it to be nothing but fire … Or they could determine it to be nothing but air … Or they could determine it to be nothing but beautiful … Or they could determine it to be nothing but ugly. Why is that? Because the element of ugliness exists in the tree trunk. Relying on that a mendicant with psychic powers could determine it to be nothing but ugly.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.42 : With Nāgita </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased; and he explains a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” Then, when the night had passed, they took many different foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant. Then the Buddha said to Nāgita, “Nāgita, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many different foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me. There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can.

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent! Now is the time for the Buddha to relent. Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill. In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. Why is that? Because of the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.43 : The Giant </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother for the day’s meditation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery. In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, at that time King Pasenadi had a giant bull elephant called “White”. It emerged from the eastern gate to the beating and playing of musical instruments.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When people saw it they said, “The royal giant is so handsome! The royal giant is so good-looking! The royal giant is so lovely! The royal giant has such a huge body!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they said this, Venerable Udāyī said to the Buddha, “Sir, is it only when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body that people say: ‘A giant, such a giant’? Or do they say it when they see any other creatures with huge, formidable bodies?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Udāyī, when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body people say: ‘A giant, such a giant!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">And also when they see a horse with a huge, formidable body …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they see a bull with a huge, formidable body …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they see a snake with a huge, formidable body …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they see a tree with a huge, formidable body …</p>
<p class="bodytext">And when they see a human being with such a huge, formidable body people say: ‘A giant, such a giant!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">But Udāyī, one who does nothing monstrous by way of body, speech, and mind is who I call a ‘giant’ in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How well said this was by the Buddha: ‘But Udāyī, one who does nothing monstrous by way of body, speech, and mind is who I call a “giant” in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.’ And I celebrate the well-spoken words of the Buddha with these verses:</p>
<p class="gatha0">Awakened as a human being, </p>
<p class="gatha">self-tamed and immersed in samādhi, </p>
<p class="gatha">following the spiritual path, </p>
<p class="gatha">he loves peace of mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Revered by people, </p>
<p class="gatha">gone beyond all things, </p>
<p class="gatha">even the gods revere him; </p>
<p class="gatha">so I’ve heard from the perfected one.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He has transcended all fetters </p>
<p class="gatha">and escaped from entanglements. </p>
<p class="gatha">Delighting to renounce sensual pleasures, </p>
<p class="gatha">he’s freed like gold from stone.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That giant outshines all, </p>
<p class="gatha">like the Himalaya beside other mountains. </p>
<p class="gatha">Of all those named ‘giant’, </p>
<p class="gatha">he is truly named, supreme.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I’ll extol the giant for you, </p>
<p class="gatha">for he does nothing monstrous. </p>
<p class="gatha">Gentleness and harmlessness </p>
<p class="gatha">are two feet of the giant.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Austerity and celibacy </p>
<p class="gatha">are his two other feet. </p>
<p class="gatha">Faith is the giant’s trunk, </p>
<p class="gatha">and equanimity his white tusks.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mindfulness is his neck, his head is wisdom— </p>
<p class="gatha">inquiry and thinking about principles. </p>
<p class="gatha">His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma, </p>
<p class="gatha">and his tail is seclusion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Practicing absorption, enjoying the breath, </p>
<p class="gatha">he is serene within. </p>
<p class="gatha">The giant is serene when walking, </p>
<p class="gatha">the giant is serene when standing,</p>
<p class="bodytext">the giant is serene when lying down, </p>
<p class="gatha">and when sitting, the giant is serene. </p>
<p class="gatha">The giant is restrained everywhere: </p>
<p class="gatha">this is the accomplishment of the giant.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He eats blameless things, </p>
<p class="gatha">he doesn’t eat blameworthy things. </p>
<p class="gatha">When he gets food and clothes, </p>
<p class="gatha">he avoids storing them up.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Having severed all bonds, </p>
<p class="gatha">fetters large and small, </p>
<p class="gatha">wherever he goes, </p>
<p class="gatha">he goes without concern.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A white lotus, </p>
<p class="gatha">fragrant and delightful, </p>
<p class="gatha">sprouts in water and grows there, </p>
<p class="gatha">but the water doesn’t cling to it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Just so the Buddha is born in the world, </p>
<p class="gatha">and lives in the world, </p>
<p class="gatha">but the world doesn’t stick to him, </p>
<p class="gatha">as the water does not stick to the lotus.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A great blazing fire </p>
<p class="gatha">dies down when the fuel runs out. </p>
<p class="gatha">When the coals have gone out </p>
<p class="gatha">it’s said to be ‘extinguished’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This simile is taught by the discerning </p>
<p class="gatha">to express the meaning clearly. </p>
<p class="gatha">Great giants will understand </p>
<p class="gatha">what the giant taught the giant.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Free of greed, free of hate, </p>
<p class="gatha">free of delusion, undefiled; </p>
<p class="gatha">the giant, giving up his body, </p>
<p class="gatha">will become extinguished without defilements.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.44 : With Migasālā </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the laywoman Migasālā, where he sat on the seat spread out.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the laywoman Migasālā went up to Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Ānanda, how on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?</p>
<p class="bodytext">My father Purāṇa was celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex. When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was a once-returner, who was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But my uncle Isidatta was not celibate; he lived content with his wife. When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was also a once-returner, who was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">How on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You’re right, sister, but that’s how the Buddha declared it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Ānanda, after receiving almsfood at Migasālā’s house, rose from his seat and left. Then after the meal, on his return from alms-round, Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, who is this laywoman Migasālā, a foolish incompetent matron, with an matron’s wit? And who is it that knows how to assess individuals? These six people are found in the world. What six?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take a certain person who is sweet-natured and pleasant to be with. And spiritual companions enjoy living together with them. And they’ve not listened or learned or comprehended theoretically or found even temporary freedom. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re headed for a lower place, not a higher. They’re going to a lower place, not a higher.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take another person who is sweet-natured and pleasant to be with. And spiritual companions enjoy living together with them.

<p class="bodytext">Judgmental people compare them, saying: ‘This one has just the same qualities as the other, so why is one worse and one better?’ This will be for their lasting harm and suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In this case, the person who is sweet-natured … and has listened, learned, comprehended theoretically, and found temporary freedom is better and finer than the other person. Why is that? Because the stream of the teaching carries them along. But who knows the difference between them except a Realized One?</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, Ānanda, don’t be judgmental about people. Don’t pass judgment on people. Those who pass judgment on people harm themselves. I, or someone like me, may pass judgment on people.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take another person who is angry and conceited, and from time to time has greedy thoughts.

They’re going to a lower place, not a higher.</p>

And if Purāṇa had achieved Isidatta’s level of wisdom, Isidatta could not have even known Purāṇa’s destination. So both individuals were lacking in one respect.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.45 : Debt </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, isn’t poverty suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When a poor, penniless person falls into debt, isn’t being in debt also suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When a poor person who has fallen into debt agrees to pay interest, isn’t the interest also suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When a poor person who has fallen into debt and agreed to pay interest fails to pay it when it falls due, they get a warning. Isn’t being warned suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When a poor person fails to pay after getting a warning, they’re prosecuted. Isn’t being prosecuted suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When a poor person fails to pay after being prosecuted, they’re imprisoned. Isn’t being imprisoned suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So mendicants, poverty, debt, interest, warnings, prosecution, and imprisonment are suffering in the world for those who enjoy sensual pleasures. In the same way, whoever has no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities is called poor and penniless in the training of the noble one.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since they have no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, or wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities, they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. This is how they’re in debt, I say.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In order to conceal the bad things they do by way of body, speech, and mind they harbour corrupt wishes. They wish, plan, speak, and act with the thought: ‘May no-one find me out!’ This is how they pay interest, I say.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Good-hearted spiritual companions say this about them: ‘This venerable acts like this, and behaves like that.’ This is how they’re warned, I say.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they go to a wilderness, the root of a tree, or an empty hut, they’re beset by remorseful, unskillful thoughts. This is how they’re prosecuted, I say.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That poor, penniless person has done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re trapped in the prison of hell or the animal realm. I don’t see a single prison that’s as brutal, as vicious, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary as the prison of hell or the animal realm.</p>
<p class="gatha0">Poverty is said to be suffering in the world, </p>

<p class="gatha">A poor person who has fallen in debt </p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.46 : By Mahācunda </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time Venerable Mahācunda was staying in the land of the Cetis at Sahajāti. There he addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahācunda said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Take a case where mendicants who practice discernment of principles rebuke mendicants who practice absorption meditation: ‘They say, ‘We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!’ And they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate. Why do they practice absorption meditation? In what way do they practice absorption meditation? How do they practice absorption meditation?’ In this case the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, take a case where mendicants who practice absorption meditation rebuke mendicants who practice discernment of principles: ‘They say, “We practice discernment of principles! We practice discernment of principles!” But they’re restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. Why do they practice discernment of principles? In what way do they practice discernment of principles? How do they practice discernment of principles?’ In this case the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, take a case where mendicants who practice discernment of principles praise only others like them, not mendicants who practice absorption meditation. In this case the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.</p>

<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this: ‘As mendicants who practice discernment of principles, we will praise mendicants who practice absorption meditation.’ That’s how you should train.

<p class="bodytext">“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.49 : With Khema </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Khema and Venerable Sumana were staying near Sāvatthī in the Dark Forest. Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Venerable Khema said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—does not think: ‘There is someone better than me, or equal to me, or worse than me.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what Khema said, and the teacher approved. Then Khema, knowing that the teacher approved, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then, not long after Khema had left, Sumana said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—does not think: ‘There is someone better than me, or equal to me, or worse than me.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what Sumana said, and the teacher approved. Then Sumana, knowing that the teacher approved, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then, soon after Khema and Sumana had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, this is how gentlemen declare enlightenment. The goal is spoken of, but the self is not involved. But it seems that there are some foolish people here who declare enlightenment as a joke. Later they will fall into anguish.</p>
<p class="gatha0">They don’t rank themselves </p>
<p class="gatha">as being higher, or lower, or equal. </p>
<p class="gatha">Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed. </p>
<p class="gatha">They live freed from fetters.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.50 : Sense Restraint </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when there is no sense restraint, one who lacks sense restraint has destroyed a vital condition for ethical conduct. When there is no ethical conduct, one who lacks ethics has destroyed a vital condition for right immersion. When there is no right immersion, one who lacks right immersion has destroyed a vital condition for true knowledge and vision. When there is no true knowledge and vision, one who lacks true knowledge and vision has destroyed a vital condition for disillusionment and dispassion. When there is no disillusionment and dispassion, one who lacks disillusionment and dispassion has destroyed a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a tree that lacked branches and foliage. Its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood would not grow to fullness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when there is no sense restraint, one who lacks sense restraint has destroyed a vital condition for ethical conduct. … One who lacks disillusionment and dispassion has destroyed a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When there is sense restraint, one who has sense restraint has fulfilled a vital condition for ethical conduct. When there is ethical conduct, one who has fulfilled ethical conduct has fulfilled a vital condition for right immersion. When there is right immersion, one who has fulfilled right immersion has fulfilled a vital condition for true knowledge and vision. When there is true knowledge and vision, one who has fulfilled true knowledge and vision has fulfilled a vital condition for disillusionment and dispassion. When there is disillusionment and dispassion, one who has fulfilled disillusionment and dispassion has fulfilled a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a tree that was complete with branches and foliage. Its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood would all grow to fullness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when there is sense restraint, one who has fulfilled sense restraint has fulfilled a vital condition for ethical conduct. … One who has fulfilled disillusionment and dispassion has fulfilled a vital condition for knowledge and vision of freedom.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.51 : With Ānanda </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Ānanda sat down to one side, and said to Sāriputta:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Sāriputta, how does a mendicant get to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before? How do they remember those teachings they have heard? How do they keep rehearsing the teachings they’ve already got to know? And how do they come to understand what they haven’t understood before?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, Venerable Ānanda, you’re very learned. Why don’t you clarify this yourself?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, Reverend Sāriputta, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” Sāriputta replied. Ānanda said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Sāriputta, take a mendicant who memorizes the teaching— statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, just as they learned and memorized it, they teach others in detail, make them recite in detail, practice reciting in detail, and think about and consider the teaching in their heart, examining it with the mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They enter the rains retreat in a monastery with senior mendicants who are very learned, knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the texts on monastic training, and the outlines. From time to time they go up to those mendicants and ask them questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is how a mendicant gets to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before. It’s how they remember those teachings they have heard. It’s how they keep rehearsing the teachings they’ve already got to know. And it’s how they come to understand what they haven’t understood before.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, reverend, it’s amazing! How well said this was by Venerable Ānanda! And we will remember Venerable Ānanda as someone who has these six qualities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For Ānanda memorizes the teaching … statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications. Those venerables clarify to Ānanda what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.52 : Aristocrats </h3>
<p class="bodytext">And then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Aristocrats, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Aristocrats, brahmin, have wealth as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with wisdom. They’re dedicated to power. They insist on territory. Their ultimate goal is authority.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Brahmins, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Brahmins have wealth as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with wisdom. They’re dedicated to the hymns. They insist on sacrifice. Their ultimate goal is the Brahmā realm.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householders, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householders have wealth as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with wisdom. They’re dedicated to their profession. They insist on work. Their ultimate goal is to complete their work.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Women, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Women have a man as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with adornments. They’re dedicated to their children. They insist on being without a co-wife. Their ultimate goal is authority.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Bandits, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Bandits have theft as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with a hiding place. They’re dedicated to their sword. They insist on darkness. Their ultimate goal is invisibility.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ascetics, Master Gotama, have what as their ambition? What is their preoccupation? What are they dedicated to? What do they insist on? What is their ultimate goal?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ascetics have patience and gentleness as their ambition. They’re preoccupied with wisdom. They’re dedicated to ethical conduct. They insist on owning nothing. Their ultimate goal is extinguishment.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing! Master Gotama knows the ambition, preoccupation, dedication, insistence, and ultimate goal of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, women, bandits, and ascetics. Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.53 : Diligence </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, brahmin.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So what is it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Diligence, brahmin, is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint. So an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. In the same way, diligence is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The rafters of a bungalow all lean to the peak, slope to the peak, and meet at the peak, so the peak is said to be the topmost of them all. In the same way, diligence is one thing …</p>
<p class="bodytext">A reed-cutter, having cut the reeds, grabs them at the top and shakes them down, shakes them about, and shakes them off. In the same way, diligence is one thing …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut, all the mangoes attached to the stalk will follow along. In the same way, diligence is one thing …</p>
<p class="bodytext">All lesser rulers are vassals of a wheel-turning monarch, so the wheel-turning monarch is said to be the foremost of them all. In the same way, diligence is one thing …</p>
<p class="bodytext">The radiance of all the stars is not worth a sixteenth part of the moon’s radiance, so the moon’s radiance is said to be the best of them all. In the same way, diligence is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is the one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both the present life and lives to come.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.54 : About Dhammika </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Dhammika was a resident in all seven monasteries of his native land. There he abused visiting mendicants; he insulted, harmed, attacked, and harassed them. The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way did not stay. They left, abandoning the monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the local lay followers thought to themselves, “We have supplied the mendicant Saṅgha with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But the visiting mendicants don’t stay. They leave, abandoning the monastery. What is the cause, what is the reason for this?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the local lay followers thought to themselves, “This Venerable Dhammika abuses visiting mendicants; he insults, harms, attacks, and harasses them. The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way do not stay. They leave, abandoning the monastery. Why don’t we banish Venerable Dhammika?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the local lay followers went up to Venerable Dhammika and said to him, “Sir, please leave this monastery. You’ve stayed here long enough.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Dhammika left and went to another monastery. There he abused visiting mendicants; he insulted, harmed, attacked, and harassed them. The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way did not stay. They left, abandoning the monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the local lay followers thought to themselves: …</p>
<p class="bodytext">They said to Venerable Dhammika, “Sir, please leave this monastery. You’ve stayed here long enough.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Dhammika left and went to another monastery. There he abused visiting mendicants; he insulted, harmed, attacked, and harassed them. The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way did not stay. They left, abandoning the monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the local lay followers thought to themselves, “Why don’t we banish Venerable Dhammika from all seven monasteries in our native land?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the local lay followers went up to Venerable Dhammika and said to him, “Sir, please leave all seven monasteries in our native land.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Dhammika thought, “I’ve been banished by the local lay followers from all seven monasteries in my native land. Where am I to go now?” He thought, “Why don’t I go to see the Buddha?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Dhammika took his bowl and robe and set out for Rājagaha. Eventually he came to Rājagaha and the Vulture’s Peak. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “So, Brahmin Dhammika, where have you come from?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I’ve been banished by the local lay followers from all seven monasteries in my native land.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Enough, Brahmin Dhammika, what’s that to you? Now that you’ve been banished from all of those places, you have come to me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once upon a time, some sea-merchants set sail for the ocean deeps, taking with them a land-spotting bird. When their ship was out of sight of land, they released the bird. It flew right away to the east, the west, the north, the south, upwards, and in-between. If it saw land on any side, it went there and stayed. But if it saw no land on any side it returned to the ship. In the same way, now that you’ve been banished from all of those places, you have come to me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once upon a time, King Koravya had a royal banyan tree with five trunks called ‘Well Planted’. It was shady and lovely. Its canopy spread over twelve leagues, while the network of roots spread for five leagues. Its fruits were as large as a rice pot. And they were as sweet as pure wild honey. The king and harem made use of one trunk, the troops another, the people of town and country another, ascetics and brahmins another, and beasts and birds another. No-one guarded the fruit, yet no-one damaged another’s fruits.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain person ate as much as he liked of the fruit, then broke off a branch and left. Then the deity haunting the royal banyan tree thought, ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! How wicked this person is, to eat as much as they like, then break off a branch and leave! Why don’t I make sure that the royal banyan tree gives no fruit in future?’ Then the royal banyan tree gave no more fruit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then King Koravya went up to Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him, ‘Please sir, you should know that the royal banyan tree called Well Planted gives no fruit.’ Then Sakka used his psychic powers to will that a violent storm come. And it felled and uprooted the royal banyan tree. Then the deity haunting the tree stood to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sakka went up to that deity, and said, ‘Why, god, are you standing to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Because, my good sir, a violent storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Well, did you stand by your tree’s duty when the storm came?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘But my good sir, how does a tree stand by its duty?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘It’s when those who need the tree’s roots, bark, leaves, flowers, or fruit take what they need. Yet the deity is not displeased or upset because of this. This is how a tree stands by its duty.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘I was not standing by a tree’s duty when the storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘God, if you were to stand by a tree’s duty, your home may be as it was before.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘I will stand by a tree’s duty! May my home be as it was before!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sakka used his psychic power to will that a violent storm come. And it raised up that mighty banyan tree and the bark of the roots was healed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, Brahmin Dhammika, were you standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished you from all seven of the monasteries in your native land?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, how do I stand by an ascetic’s duty?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When someone abuses, annoys, or argues with an ascetic, the ascetic doesn’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them. That’s how an ascetic stands by an ascetic’s duty.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I was not standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished me from all seven of the monasteries in my native land.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Once upon a time, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire. He had many hundreds of disciples. He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā. Those lacking confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Those full of confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha … Aranemi … Kuddālaka … Hatthipāla … Jotipāla. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire. He had many hundreds of disciples. He taught them the way to rebirth in the company of Brahmā. Those lacking confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Those full of confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Brahmin Dhammika? If someone with malicious intent were to abuse and insult these six teachers with their hundreds of followers, would they not make much bad karma?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“They would indeed. But someone who abuses and insults a single person accomplished in view with malicious intent makes even more bad karma. Why is that? Brahmin Dhammika, I say that any injury done by those outside of the Buddhist community does not compare with what is done to one’s own spiritual companions. So you should train like this: ‘We will have no malicious intent for those who we want to have as our spiritual companions.’ That is how you should train.</p>
<p class="gatha0">Sunetta and Mūgapakkha, </p>
<p class="gatha">and Aranemi the brahmin, </p>
<p class="gatha">Hatthipāla the student, </p>

<p class="title">6. The Great Chapter</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.55 : With Soṇa </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Soṇa was staying at Rājagaha in the Cool Wood. Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples. Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit. Why don’t I reject the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha knew what Venerable Soṇa was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Vulture’s Peak and reappeared in the Cool Wood in front of Soṇa, and sat on the seat spread out. Soṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha said to him, “Soṇa, as you were in private retreat didn’t this thought come to your mind: ‘I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples. Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit. Why don’t I reject the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Soṇa? When you were still a layman, weren’t you a good harp player?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When your harp’s strings were tuned too tight, was it resonant and playable?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When your harp’s strings were tuned too slack, was it resonant and playable?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But when your harp’s strings were tuned neither too tight nor too slack, but fixed at an even tension, was it resonant and playable?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, Soṇa, when energy is too forceful it leads to restlessness. When energy is too slack it leads to laziness. So, Soṇa, you should apply yourself to energy and serenity, find a balance of the faculties, and learn the pattern of this situation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Soṇa replied.</p>
<p class="bodytext">After advising Soṇa like this, the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Cool Wood and reappeared on the Vulture’s Peak.</p>
<p class="bodytext">After some time Soṇa applied himself to energy and serenity, found a balance of the faculties, and learned the pattern of this situation. Then Soṇa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, when Soṇa had attained perfection, he thought, “Why don’t I go to the Buddha and declare my enlightenment in his presence?” Then Soṇa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is dedicated to six things. They are dedicated to renunciation, seclusion, kindness, the ending of craving, the ending of grasping, and mental clarity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks: ‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to renunciation solely out of mere faith.’ But it should not be seen like this. A mendicant with defilements ended does not see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement. They’re dedicated to renunciation because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks: ‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to seclusion because they enjoy possessions, honor, and popularity.’ But it should not be seen like this. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks: ‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to kindness because they believe that adhering to precepts and observances is the most important thing.’ But it should not be seen like this. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re dedicated to the ending of craving because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re dedicated to the ending of grasping because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re dedicated to clarity of mind because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind. The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance. Even if compelling sounds … smells … tastes … touches … and thoughts come into the range of the mind they don’t overcome the mind. The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a mountain that was one solid mass of rock, without cracks or holes. Even if violent storms were to blow up out of the east, the west, the north, and the south, they couldn’t make it shake or rock or tremble.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind. … The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance.</p>
<p class="gatha0">When you’re dedicated to renunciation </p>
<p class="gatha">and seclusion of the heart; </p>
<p class="gatha">when you’re dedicated to kindness </p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.56 : With Phagguṇa </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Phagguṇa was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, Venerable Phagguṇa is sick. Sir, please go to Venerable Phagguṇa out of compassion.” The Buddha consented in silence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Venerable Phagguṇa. Venerable Phagguṇa saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and tried to rise on his cot.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha said to him, “It’s all right, Phagguṇa, don’t get up. There are some seats spread out by others, I will sit there.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">He sat on the seat spread out and said to Venerable Phagguṇa: “Phagguṇa, I hope you’re keeping well; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point. I’m not keeping well.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head. I’m not keeping well.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The winds piercing my belly are so severe, it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver. I’m not keeping well.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Venerable Phagguṇa with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Not long after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguṇa passed away. At the time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguṇa died. At the time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And why shouldn’t his faculties be bright and clear? The mendicant Phagguṇa’s mind was not freed from the five lower fetters. But when he heard that teaching his mind was freed from them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ānanda, there are these six benefits to hearing the teaching at the right time and examining the meaning at the right time. What six?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters. At the time of death they get to see the Realized One. The Realized One teaches them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. When they hear that teaching their mind is freed from the five lower fetters. This is the first benefit of listening to the teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters. At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, but they get to see a Realized One’s disciple. The Realized One’s disciple teaches them Dhamma … When they hear that teaching their mind is freed from the five lower fetters. This is the second benefit of listening to the teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters. At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, or to see a Realized One’s disciple. But they think about and consider the teaching in their heart, examining it with the mind as they learned and memorized it. As they do so their mind is freed from the five lower fetters. This is the third benefit of listening to the teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Next, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments. At the time of death they get to see the Realized One. The Realized One teaches them Dhamma … When they hear that teaching their mind is freed with the supreme ending of attachments. This is the fourth benefit of listening to the teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments. At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, but they get to see a Realized One’s disciple. The Realized One’s disciple teaches them Dhamma … When they hear that teaching their mind is freed with the supreme ending of attachments. This is the fifth benefit of listening to the teaching.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.57 : The Six Classes of Rebirth </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa describes six classes of rebirth: black, blue, red, yellow, white, and ultimate white.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The black class of rebirth consists of slaughterers of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, hunters or fishers, bandits, executioners, butchers of cattle, jailers, and any others with a cruel livelihood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The blue class of rebirth consists of mendicants who live on thorns, and any others who teach the efficacy of deeds and action.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The red class of rebirth consists of the Jain ascetics who wear one cloth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The yellow class of rebirth consists of the lay people dressed in white who are disciples of the naked ascetics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The white class of rebirth consists of male and female <i>Ājīvaka</i>ascetics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the ultimate white class of rebirth consists of Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and Makkhali Gosāla.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are the six classes of rebirth that Pūraṇa Kassapa describes.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Ānanda, did the whole world authorize Pūraṇa Kassapa to describe these six classes of rebirth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s as if they were to force a steak on a poor, penniless person, telling them they must eat it and then pay for it. In the same way, Pūraṇa Kassapa has described these six classes of rebirth without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins. And he has done so in a foolish, incompetent, unskilled way, lacking common sense.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I, however, also describe six classes of rebirth. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what, Ānanda, are the six classes of rebirth? Someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result. Someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result. Someone born into a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright. Someone born into a bright class gives rise to a dark result. Someone born into a bright class gives rise to a bright result. Someone born into a bright class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a dark result? It’s when someone is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, chronically ill—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting. And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a bright result? It’s when some person is reborn in a low family … But they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. That’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright? It’s when some person is reborn in a low family … They shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. They give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. They firmly establish their mind in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They truly develop the seven awakening factors. And then they give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright. That’s how someone born in a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to a dark result? It’s when some person is reborn in an eminent family—a well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain. And they’re attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. But they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That’s how someone born into a bright class gives rise to a dark result.</p>

<p class="bodytext">These are the six classes of rebirth.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.58 : Defilements </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant with six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What six?</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s a mendicant who, by restraint, has given up the defilements that should be given up by restraint. By using, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by using. By enduring, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by enduring. By avoiding, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by avoiding. By getting rid, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by getting rid. By developing, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by developing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the defilements that should be given up by restraint? Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, lives restraining the eye faculty. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise when there is such restraint. Reflecting properly, they live restraining the ear faculty … the nose faculty … the tongue faculty … the body faculty … the mind faculty. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the mind faculty do not arise when there is such restraint. These are called the defilements that should be given up by restraint.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the defilements that should be given up by using? Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, makes use of robes: ‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.’ Reflecting properly, they make use of almsfood: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ Reflecting properly, they make use of lodgings: ‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.’ Reflecting properly, they make use of medicines and supplies for the sick: ‘Only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.’ For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without using these things do not arise when they are used. These are called the defilements that should be given up by using.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the defilements that should be given up by enduring? Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without enduring these things do not arise when they are endured. These are called the defilements that should be given up by enduring.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the defilements that should be given up by avoiding? Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a cliff, a swamp, and a sewer. Reflecting properly, they avoid sitting on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and mixing with bad friends—whatever sensible spiritual companions would believe to be a bad setting. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoided. These are called the defilements that should be given up by avoiding.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the defilements that should be given up by getting rid? Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without getting rid of these things do not arise when they are gotten rid of. These are called the defilements that should be given up by getting rid.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the defilements that should be given up by developing? Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without developing these things do not arise when they are developed. These are called the defilements that should be given up by developing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant with these six factors is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.59 : With Dārukammika </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the householder Dārukammika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Householder, I wonder whether your family gives gifts?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It does, sir. Gifts are given to those mendicants who are perfected or on the path to perfection; they live in the wilderness, eat only alms-food, and wear rag robes.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and money, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If a mendicant living in the wilderness is restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties, then in this respect they’re reprehensible. If a mendicant living in the wilderness is not restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, or loose-tongued, but has established mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion, with unified mind and restrained faculties, then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If a mendicant who lives in the neighborhood of a village is restless … then in this respect they’re reprehensible. If a mendicant who lives in the neighborhood of a village is not restless … then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If a mendicant who eats only alms-food is restless … then in this respect they’re reprehensible. If a mendicant who eats only alms-food is not restless … then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If a mendicant who accepts invitations is restless … then in this respect they’re reprehensible. If a mendicant who accepts invitations is not restless … then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If a mendicant who wears rag robes is restless … then in this respect they’re reprehensible. If a mendicant who wears rag robes is not restless … then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If a mendicant who wears robes offered by householders is restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties, then in this respect they’re reprehensible. If a mendicant who wears robes offered by householders is not restless, insolent, fickle, gossipy, or loose-tongued, but has established mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion, with unified mind and restrained faculties, then in this respect they’re praiseworthy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Go ahead, householder, give gifts to the Saṅgha. Your mind will become bright and clear, and when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, from this day forth I will give gifts to the Saṅgha.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.60 : With Hatthisāriputta </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time several senior mendicants, after the meal, on their return from alms-round, sat together in the pavilion talking about the teachings. Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta interrupted them while they were talking.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta, “Venerable, please don’t interrupt the senior mendicants while they’re talking about the teachings. Wait until the end of the discussion.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Citta Hatthisāriputta’s companions said to Mahākoṭṭhita, “Venerable, please don’t rebuke Citta Hatthisāriputta. He is astute, and quite capable of talking about the teachings with the senior mendicants.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s not easy to know this, reverends, for those who don’t comprehend another’s mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet, the most unruffled of the unruffled, the calmest of the calm, so long as they live relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. But when they’re separated from the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role, they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their ministers, and with teachers of other paths and their followers. As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind. They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose an ox fond of crops was tied up or shut in a pen. Would it be right to say that that ox will never again invade the crops?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No it would not, reverend. For it’s quite possible that that ox will snap the ropes or break out of the pen, and then invade the crops.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet … As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind. They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take the case of a person who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption. Thinking, ‘I get the first absorption!’ they mix closely with monks … They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose it was raining heavily at the crossroads so that the dust vanished and mud appeared. Would it be right to say that now dust will never appear at this crossroad again?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No it would not, reverend. For it is quite possible that people or cattle and so on will cross over the crossroad, or that the wind and sun will evaporate the moisture so that the dust appears again.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, take the case of a person who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption. Thinking, ‘I get the first absorption!’ they mix closely with monks … They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take another case of a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … enters and remains in the second absorption. Thinking, ‘I get the second absorption!’ they mix closely with monks … They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a large pond not far from a town or village. After it rained heavily there the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel would vanish. Would it be right to say that now the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel will never appear here again?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No it would not, reverend. For it’s quite possible that people or cattle and so on will drink from the pond, or that the wind and sun will evaporate it so that the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel appear again.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, take another case of a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … enters and remains in the second absorption. Thinking, ‘I get the second absorption!’ they mix closely with monks … They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take the case of another person who, with the fading away of rapture … enters and remains in the third absorption. Thinking, ‘I get the third absorption!’ they mix closely with monks … They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a person had finished a delicious meal. They’d have no appetite for leftovers. Would it be right to say that now food will never appeal to this person again?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No it would not, reverend. For it’s quite possible that other food won’t appeal to that person as long as the nourishment is still present. But when the nourishment vanishes food will appeal again.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, take the case of a person who, with the fading away of rapture … enters and remains in the third absorption. Thinking, ‘I get the third absorption!’ they mix closely with monks … They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take the case of another person who, giving up pleasure and pain … enters and remains in the fourth absorption. Thinking, ‘I get the fourth absorption!’ they mix closely with monks … They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake, unruffled and free of waves. Would it be right to say that now waves will never appear in this lake again?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No it would not, reverend. For it is quite possible that a violent storm could blow up out of the east, west, north, or south, and stir up waves in that lake.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, take the case of a person who, giving up pleasure and pain … enters and remains in the fourth absorption. Thinking, ‘I get the fourth absorption!’ they mix closely with monks … They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take the case of another person who, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Thinking, ‘I get the signless immersion of the heart!’ they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their ministers, and with teachers of other paths and their followers. As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind. They reject the training and return to a lesser life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a ruler or their minister, while walking along the road with an army of four divisions, was to arrive at a forest grove where they set up camp for the night. There, because of the noise of the elephants, horses, chariots, soldiers, and the drums, kettledrums, horns, and cymbals, the chirping of crickets would vanish. Would it be right to say that now the chirping of crickets will never be heard in this woodland grove again?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No it would not, reverend. For it is quite possible that the ruler or their minister will depart from that woodland grove so that the chirping of crickets will be heard there again.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, take the case of a person who, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart … They reject the training and return to a lesser life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then after some time Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta rejected the training and returned to a lesser life. Then the mendicants who were his companions went up to Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita and said, “Did Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita comprehend Citta Hatthisāriputta’s mind and know that he had gained such and such meditative attainments, yet he would still reject the training and return to a lesser life? Or did deities tell you about it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, I comprehended his mind and knew this. And deities also told me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the mendicants who were Citta Hatthisāriputta’s companions went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Citta Hatthisāriputta, who had gained such and such meditative attainments, has still rejected the training and returned to a lesser life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, soon Citta will remember renunciation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And not long after Citta Hatthisāriputta shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. Then Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfected.</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.61 : In the Middle </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time, after the meal, on return from alms-round, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them, “Reverends, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘The sage has known both ends, </p>
<p class="gatha">and is not stuck in the middle. </p>
<p class="gatha">He is a great man, I declare, </p>
<p class="gatha">he has escaped the seamstress here.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">But what is one end? What’s the second end? What’s the middle? And who is the seamstress?” When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Contact, reverends, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress, for craving weaves one to rebirth in this or that state of existence. That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The past, reverends, is one end. The future is the second end. The present is the middle. And craving is the seamstress … That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Pleasant feeling, reverends, is one end. Painful feeling is the second end. Neutral feeling is the middle. And craving is the seamstress … That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Name, reverends, is one end. Form is the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress … That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The six interior sense fields, reverends, are one end. The six exterior sense fields are the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress … That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Identity, reverends, is one end. The origin of identity is the second end. The cessation of identity is the middle. And craving is the seamstress, for craving weaves one to rebirth in this or that state of existence. That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Each of us has spoken from the heart. Come, reverends, let’s go to the Buddha, and inform him about this. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” those senior mendicants replied. Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. They asked, “Sir, who has spoken well?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, you’ve all spoken well in a way. However, this is what I was referring to in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’ when I said:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘The sage has known both ends, </p>
<p class="gatha">and is not stuck in the middle. </p>
<p class="gatha">He is a great man, I declare, </p>
<p class="gatha">he has escaped the seamstress here.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Contact, mendicants, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress, for craving weaves one to rebirth in this or that state of existence. That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.62 : Knowledge of the Faculties of Persons </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kosalans named Daṇḍakappaka. The Buddha left the road and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out. The mendicants entered Daṇḍakappaka to look for a guest house.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Aciravati River to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Ānanda, and said to him, “Reverend Ānanda, when the Buddha declared that Devadatta was going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable, did he do so after wholeheartedly deliberating, or was this just a way of speaking?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You’re right, reverend, that’s how the Buddha declared it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, that mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant. How on earth can he take something that I have declared definitively to be ambiguous? I do not see a single other person concerning whom I have made a declaration about after giving such wholehearted deliberation as Devadatta.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As long as I saw even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta I did not declare that he was going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. But when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta I declared that he was going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a sewer deeper than a man’s height, full to the brim with feces, and someone was sunk into it over their head. Then along comes a person who wants to help make them safe, who wants to lift them out of that sewer. But circling all around the sewer they couldn’t see even a fraction of a hair’s tip on that person that was not smeared with feces.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta I declared that he was going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. Ānanda, if only you would all listen to the Realized One’s analysis of the knowledges of the faculties of individuals.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha analyze the faculties of persons. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘The skillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the unskillful qualities are still present. Nevertheless, their skillful root is unbroken, and from that the skillful will appear. So this person is not liable to decline in the future.’ Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. They’re sown in a well-prepared, productive field. Wouldn’t you know that those seeds would grow, increase, and mature?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … This person is not liable to decline in the future … This is how another individual is known to the Realized One by comprehending their mind. And this is how the Realized One knows a person’s faculties by comprehending their mind.

Nevertheless, their unskillful root is unbroken, and from that the unskillful will appear. So this person is still liable to decline in the future.’ Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. And they were sown on a broad rock. Wouldn’t you know that those seeds would not grow, increase, and mature?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … This person is still liable to decline in the future … This is how another individual is known to the Realized One …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness. They have exclusively dark, unskillful qualities. When their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ Suppose some seeds were broken, spoiled, weather-damaged. They’re sown in a well-prepared, productive field. Wouldn’t you know that those seeds would not grow, increase, and mature?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … ‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness. They have exclusively dark, unskillful qualities. When their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Sir, can you describe three other persons who are counterparts of these three?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I can, Ānanda,” said the Buddha. “Ānanda, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘The skillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the unskillful qualities are still present. Nevertheless, their skillful root is unbroken, but it’s about to be totally destroyed. So this person is still liable to decline in the future.’ Suppose that there were some burning coals, blazing and glowing. And they were placed on a broad rock. Wouldn’t you know that those coals would not grow, increase, and spread?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Or suppose it was the late afternoon and the sun was going down. Wouldn’t you know that the light was about to vanish and darkness appear?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Or suppose that it’s nearly time for the midnight meal. Wouldn’t you know that the light had vanished and the darkness appeared?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … This person is still liable to decline in the future …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘The unskillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the skillful qualities are still present. Nevertheless, their unskillful root is unbroken, but it’s about to be totally destroyed. So this person is not liable to decline in the future.’ Suppose that there were some burning coals, blazing and glowing. They were placed on a pile of grass or timber. Wouldn’t you know that those coals would grow, increase, and spread?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suppose it’s the crack of dawn and the sun is rising. Wouldn’t you know that the dark will vanish and the light appear?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Or suppose that it’s nearly time for the midday meal. Wouldn’t you know that the dark had vanished and the light appeared?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … This person is not liable to decline in the future …</p>
<p class="bodytext">When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of unskillful qualities.

They were placed on a pile of grass or timber. Wouldn’t you know that those coals would not grow, increase, and spread?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … ‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of unskillful qualities.

And this is how the Realized One knows the future origination of a person’s qualities by comprehending their mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so, Ānanda, of the first three people one is not liable to decline, one is liable to decline, and one is bound for a place of loss, hell. And of the second three people, one is liable to decline, one is not liable to decline, and one is bound to become extinguished.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.63 : Penetrative </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I will teach you a penetrative exposition of the teaching. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, what is the penetrative exposition of the teaching? Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear … Smells known by the nose … Tastes known by the tongue … Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. However, these are not sensual pleasures. In the training of the noble one they’re called ‘kinds of sensual stimulation’.</p>
<p class="gatha0">Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure. </p>
<p class="gatha">The world’s pretty things aren’t sensual pleasures. </p>
<p class="gatha">Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure. </p>
<p class="gatha">The world’s pretty things stay just as they are, </p>
<p class="gatha">but a wise one removes desire for them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the source of sensual pleasures? Contact is their source.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the diversity of sensual pleasures? The sensual desire for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches are all different. This is called the diversity of sensual pleasures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the result of sensual pleasures? When one who desires sensual pleasures creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—this is called the result of sensual pleasures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the cessation of sensual pleasures? When contact ceases, sensual pleasures cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of sensual pleasures is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple understands sensual pleasures in this way—and understands their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation—they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of sensual pleasures. ‘Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? There are these three feelings: pleasant, painful, and neutral.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the source of feelings? Contact is their source.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the diversity of feelings? There are material pleasant feelings, spiritual pleasant feelings, material painful feelings, spiritual painful feelings, material neutral feelings, and spiritual neutral feelings. This is called the diversity of feelings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the result of feelings? When one who feels creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds— this is called the result of feelings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the cessation of feelings? When contact ceases, feelings cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple understands feelings in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of feelings. ‘Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? There are these six perceptions: perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the source of perceptions? Contact is their source.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the diversity of perceptions? The perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts are all different. This is called the diversity of perceptions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the result of perceptions? Communication is the result of perception, I say. You communicate something in whatever manner you perceive it, saying ‘That’s what I perceived.’ This is called the result of perceptions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the cessation of perception? When contact ceases, perception ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of perceptions is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple understands perception in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of perception. ‘Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? There are these three defilements: the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the source of defilements? Ignorance is the source of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the diversity of defilements? There are defilements that lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the world of the gods. This is called the diversity of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the result of defilements? When one who is ignorant creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—this is called the result of defilements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the cessation of defilements? When ignorance ceases, defilements cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of defilements is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple understands defilements in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of defilements. ‘Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It is intention that I call deeds. For after making a choice one acts by way of body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the source of deeds? Contact is their source.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the diversity of deeds? There are deeds that lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the world of the gods. This is called the diversity of deeds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the result of deeds? The result of deeds is threefold, I say: in this very life, on rebirth in the next life, or at some later time. This is called the result of deeds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the cessation of deeds? When contact ceases, deeds cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of deeds is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple understands deeds in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of deeds. ‘Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the source of suffering? Craving is the source of suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the diversity of suffering? There is suffering that is severe, mild, slow to fade, and quick to fade. This is called the diversity of suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the result of suffering? It’s when someone who is overcome and overwhelmed by suffering sorrows and pines and cries, beating their breast and falling into confusion. Or else, overcome by that suffering, they begin an external search, wondering: ‘Who knows one or two phrases to stop this suffering?’ The result of suffering is either confusion or a search, I say. This is called the result of suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the cessation of suffering? When craving ceases, suffering ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of suffering is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple understands suffering in this way … they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of suffering. ‘Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is the penetrative exposition of the teaching.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 6.64 : The Lion’s Roar </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, the Realized One possesses six powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel. What six?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And he lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel. These are the six powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of recollection of past lives, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of passing away and rebirth of sentient beings, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the ending of defilements, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And I say that true knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of the recollection of past lives is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of sentient beings is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of the ending of defilements is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so, mendicants, immersion is the path. No immersion is the wrong path.”</p></div>
