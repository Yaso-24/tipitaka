<h3 class="subhead">1. The Interior as Impermanent</h3>
<p class="bodytext">So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, the eye is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering is not-self. And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">The ear is impermanent. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">The nose is impermanent. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">The tongue is impermanent. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">The body is impermanent. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">The mind is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering is not-self. And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”</p>

<p class="bodytext">And what is the practice that’s conducive to uprooting all identifying? It’s when a mendicant does not identify with the eye, does not identify in the eye, does not identify from the eye, and does not identify: ‘The eye is mine.’ They don’t identify with sights … eye consciousness … eye contact. And they don’t identify with the pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact. They don’t identify in that, they don’t identify from that, and they don’t identify: ‘That is mine.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">For whatever you identify with, whatever you identify in, whatever you identify as, and whatever you identify as ‘mine’: that becomes something else. The world is attached to being, taking pleasure only in being, yet it becomes something else.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t identify with the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … They don’t identify with the pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact. They don’t identify in that, they don’t identify from that, and they don’t identify: ‘That is mine.’</p>

Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Please don’t slit your wrists! Venerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you don’t have any suitable food, we’ll find it for you. If you don’t have suitable medicine, we’ll find it for you. If you don’t have a capable carer, we’ll find one for you.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Please don’t slit your wrists! Venerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s not that I don’t have suitable food; I do have suitable food. It’s not that I don’t have suitable medicine; I do have suitable medicine. It’s not that I don’t have a capable carer; I do have a capable carer.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Moreover, for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love, not without love. For it is proper for a disciple to serve the Teacher with love, not without love. You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’d like to ask Venerable Channa about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ask, Reverend Sāriputta. When I’ve heard it I’ll know.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Do you regard the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Sāriputta, I regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">I regard the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Channa, what have you seen, what have you directly known in these things that you regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Sāriputta, after seeing cessation, after directly knowing cessation in these things I regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa, “So, Reverend Channa, you should pay close attention to this instruction of the Buddha whenever you can:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation. When there’s no agitation there is tranquility. When there’s tranquility there’s no inclination. When there’s no inclination, there’s no coming and going. When there’s no coming and going, there’s no passing away and reappearing. When there’s no passing away and reappearing, there’s no this world or world beyond or between the two. Just this is the end of suffering.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left. Not long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa slit his wrists.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Venerable Channa has slit his wrists. Where has he been reborn in his next life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sāriputta, didn’t the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, there is a Vajjian village named Pubbavijjhana where Channa had families with whom he was friendly, intimate, and familiar.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families. But this is not enough for me to call someone ‘blameworthy’. When someone lays down this body and takes up another body, I call them ‘blameworthy’. But the mendicant Channa did no such thing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly.’”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Puṇṇa, there are sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. If a mendicant approves, welcomes, and keeps clinging to them, this gives rise to relishing. Relishing is the origin of suffering, I say.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, there’s a country called Sunāparanta; I will live there.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The people of Sunāparanta are wild and rough, Puṇṇa. If they abuse and insult you, what will you think of them?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If they abuse and insult me, I will think: ‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t hit me with their fists.’ That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One. That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if they do hit you with their fists, what will you think of them then?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“But if they do throw stones at you, what will you think of them then?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If they throw stones at me, I’ll think: ‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t beat me with a club.’ That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One. That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if they do beat you with a club, what will you think of them then?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“But if they do stab you with a knife, what will you think of them then?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If they stab me with a knife, I’ll think: ‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t take my life with a sharp knife.’ That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One. That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if they do take your life with a sharp knife, what will you think of them then?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If they take my life with a sharp knife, I’ll think: ‘There are disciples of the Buddha who looked for someone to assist with slitting their wrists because they were horrified, repelled, and disgusted with the body and with life. And I have found this without looking!’ That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One. That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good Puṇṇa! Having such self-control and peacefulness, you will be quite capable of living in Sunāparanta. Now, Puṇṇa, go at your convenience.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then Puṇṇa welcomed and agreed with the Buddha’s words. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sunāparanta.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sunāparanta, and stayed there. Within that rainy season he confirmed around five hundred male and five hundred female lay followers. And within that same rainy season he realized the three knowledges. And within that same rainy season he became completely extinguished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha … and asked him, “Sir, the gentleman named Puṇṇa, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away. Where has he been reborn in his next life?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house. Then while the Buddha was in private retreat he spoke this exposition of the teaching:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘My mind might often stray towards the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished—or to those in the present, or in the future a little.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me: ‘In my own way I should practice diligence, mindfulness, and protecting the mind regarding the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, mendicants, your minds might also often stray towards the five kinds of sensual stimulation that you formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished—or to those in the present, or in the future a little. So in your own way you should practice diligence, mindfulness, and protecting the mind regarding the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should understand that dimension where the eye ceases and perception of sights fades away. You should understand that dimension where the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind ceases and perception of thoughts fades away.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, a mendicant pupil of mine has rejected the training and returned to a lesser life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s how it is, reverend, when someone doesn’t guard the sense doors, eats too much, and is not committed to wakefulness. It’s not possible for such a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life. But it is possible for a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life if they guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and are committed to wakefulness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does someone guard the sense doors? When a mendicant sees a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. That’s how someone guards the sense doors.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does someone eat in moderation? It’s when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ That’s how someone eats in moderation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is someone committed to wakefulness? It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. That’s how someone is committed to wakefulness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this: ‘We will guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and be committed to wakefulness.’ That’s how you should train.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “The qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in Rāhula. Why don’t I lead him further to the ending of defilements?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Rāhula, “Rāhula, get your sitting cloth. Let’s go to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Rāhula. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha, thinking, “Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out. Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Rāhula? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Are sights … eye consciousness … eye contact permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.” …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact: is that permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Are thoughts … mind consciousness … mind contact permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.” …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact: is that permanent or impermanent?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact. And they become disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body …</p>
<p class="bodytext">They grow disillusioned with the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact. And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, Rāhula’s mind was freed from defilements by not grasping.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those thousands of deities:</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then King Udena went up to Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Bhāradvāja, there are these young monks who are youthful, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life; and they’ve never played around with sensual pleasures. What is the cause, what is the reason why they practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Please, monks, think of women your mother’s age as your mother. Think of women your sister’s age as your sister. And think of women your daughter’s age as your daughter.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Master Bhāradvāja, the mind is wanton. Sometimes thoughts of desire come up even for women your mother’s age, your sister’s age, or your daughter’s age. Is there another cause, another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Please, monks, examine your own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is also a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life, maintaining it for a long time.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This is easy to do for those mendicants who have developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind, and wisdom. But it’s hard to do for those mendicants who have not developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind, and wisdom. Sometimes I plan to focus on something as ugly, but only its beauty comes to mind. Is there another cause, another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Please, monks, live with sense doors guarded. When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of sight, and achieve its restraint. When you hear a sound with your ears … When you smell an odor with your nose … When you taste a flavor with your tongue … When you feel a touch with your body … When you know a thought with your mind, don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming.

<p class="bodytext">This is also a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, Master Bhāradvāja, it’s amazing! How well this was said by the Buddha! This is the real cause, this is the reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For sometimes I too enter the harem with unprotected body, speech, mind, mindfulness, and sense faculties. At those times powerful thoughts of desire get the better of me. But sometimes I enter the harem with protected body, speech, mind, mindfulness, and sense faculties. At those times such thoughts of desire don’t get the better of me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Excellent, Master Bhāradvāja! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Bhāradvāja has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Bhāradvāja remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Householder, it’s when a mendicant sees a sight and understands it to be agreeable. There is eye consciousness; and pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. Then they see a sight and understand it to be disagreeable. There is eye consciousness; and painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful. Then they see a sight and understand it to be a basis for equanimity.

<p class="bodytext">Then several youths, students of the brahmin Lohicca, approached Mahākaccāna’s wilderness hut while collecting firewood. They walked and wandered all around the hut, making a dreadful racket and all kinds of jeers: “These shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman, the Lord! They’re honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated by those who pretend to inherit Vedic culture.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then Mahākaccāna left his dwelling and said to those brahmin students, “Students, stop being so noisy. I will speak to you on the teaching.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, the students fell silent. Then Mahākaccāna recited these verses for them.</p>
<p class="gatha0">“The brahmins of old excelled in ethics,</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then those students, offended and upset, went to the brahmin Lohicca and said to him, “Please, master, you should know this. The ascetic Mahākaccāna condemns and rejects outright the hymns of the brahmins!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they said this, Lohicca was offended and upset. Then he thought, “But it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to abuse or insult the ascetic Mahākaccāna solely because of what I’ve heard from these students. Why don’t I go and ask him about it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the brahmin Lohicca together with those students went to Venerable Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, “Master Kaccāna, did several young students of mine come by here collecting firewood?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“But what kind of discussion did you have with them?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This is the discussion I had with these students.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Master Kaccāna spoke of someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors. How do you define someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Brahmin, take someone who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it.

Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition of the teaching on burning. Listen …</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the exposition of the teaching on burning?</p>
<p class="bodytext">You’d be better off mutilating your eye faculty with a red-hot iron nail, burning, blazing and glowing, than getting caught up in the features by way of the details in sights known by the eye. For if you die at a time when your consciousness is still tied to gratification in the features or details, it’s possible you’ll go to one of two destinations: hell or the animal realm. I speak having seen this drawback.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You’d be better off mutilating your ear faculty with a sharp iron spike …</p>
<p class="bodytext">You’d be better off mutilating your nose faculty with a sharp nail cutter …</p>
<p class="bodytext">You’d be better off mutilating your tongue faculty with a sharp razor …</p>
<p class="bodytext">You’d be better off mutilating your body faculty with a sharp spear, burning, blazing and glowing, than getting caught up in the features by way of the details in touches known by the body. For if you die at a time when your consciousness is still tied to gratification in the features or details, it’s possible you’ll go to one of two destinations: hell or the animal realm. I speak having seen this drawback.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You’d be better off sleeping. For I say that sleep is useless, fruitless, and unconsciousness for the living. But while you’re asleep you won’t fall under the sway of such thoughts that would make you create a schism in the Saṅgha. I speak having seen this drawback.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A noble disciple reflects on this: ‘Forget mutilating the eye faculty with a red-hot iron nail, burning, blazing and glowing! I’d better focus on the fact that the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact is also impermanent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Forget mutilating the ear faculty with a sharp iron spike, burning, blazing and glowing! I’d better focus on the fact that the ear, sounds, ear consciousness, and ear contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by ear contact is also impermanent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Forget mutilating the nose faculty with a sharp nail cutter, burning, blazing and glowing! I’d better focus on the fact that the nose, smells, nose consciousness, and nose contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by nose contact is also impermanent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Forget mutilating the tongue faculty with a sharp razor, burning, blazing and glowing! I’d better focus on the fact that the tongue, tastes, tongue consciousness, and tongue contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by tongue contact is also impermanent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Forget mutilating the body faculty with a sharp spear, burning, blazing and glowing! I’d better focus on the fact that the body, touches, body consciousness, and body contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by body contact is also impermanent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Forget sleeping! I’d better focus on the fact that the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact is also impermanent.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact. And they become disillusioned with the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact. They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors?</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming.

<p class="bodytext">That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors.</p>

In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation.</p>

<p class="bodytext">It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.

The tortoise saw the jackal off in the distance hunting, so it drew its limbs and neck inside its shell, and kept still and silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But the jackal also saw the tortoise off in the distance grazing. So it went up to the tortoise and waiting nearby, thinking, ‘When that tortoise sticks one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell, I’ll grab it right there, rip it out, and eat it!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">But when that tortoise didn’t stick one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell, the jackal left disappointed, since it couldn’t find a vulnerability.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, Māra the Wicked is always waiting nearby, thinking: ‘Hopefully I can find a vulnerability in the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind.’ That’s why you should live with sense doors guarded.</p>

And assume that you don’t get taken by humans or non-humans or caught up in a whirlpool, and that you don’t rot away. In that case, you will slant, slope, and incline towards extinguishment. Why is that? Because right view slants, slopes, and inclines towards extinguishment.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, what’s the near shore and what’s the far shore? What’s sinking in the middle? What’s getting stranded on high ground? What’s getting taken by humans or non-humans? What’s getting caught up in a whirlpool? And what’s rotting away?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘The near shore’, mendicant, is a term for the six interior sense fields.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘The far shore’ is a term for the six exterior sense fields.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Sinking in the middle’ is a term for desire with relishing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Stranded on high ground’ is a term for the conceit ‘I am’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what’s getting taken by humans? It’s when someone mixes closely with laypeople, sharing their joys and sorrows—happy when they’re happy and sad when they’re sad—and getting involved in their business. That’s called getting taken by humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what’s getting taken by non-humans? It’s when someone lives the spiritual life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of gods: ‘By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ That’s called getting taken by non-humans. ‘Caught up in a whirlpool’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what’s rotting away? It’s when some person is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved. This is called ‘rotting away’.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, at that time Nanda the cowherd was sitting not far from the Buddha. Then he said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I won’t collide with the near shore or the far shore, or sink in the middle, or get stranded on high ground. And I won’t get taken by humans or non-humans or caught up in a whirlpool, and I won’t rot away. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, Nanda, return the cows to their owners.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, the cows will go back by themselves, since they love their calves.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Still, Nanda, you should return them to their owners.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Nanda, after returning the cows to their owners, went up to the Buddha and said to him, “Sir, I have returned the cows to their owners. May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the cowherd Nanda received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Nanda became one of the perfected.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Kimibilā on the bank of the Ganges river. Seeing a large tree trunk being carried along by the current, he addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, do you see that large tree trunk being carried along by the current of the Ganges river?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. … When this was said, Venerable Kimbila said to the Buddha:</p>

<h3 class="subhead">243. The Explanation on the Corrupt</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it. That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.” The Buddha consented in silence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha and told him of their preparations, saying, “Please, sir, come at your convenience.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east. The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them. The Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them, saying, “The night is getting late, Gotamas. Please go at your convenience.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied the Sakyans. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then, soon after the Sakyans had left, the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, “Moggallāna, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness. Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired. My back is sore, I’ll stretch it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Mahāmoggallāna replied. And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I will teach you the explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And how is someone corrupt?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted. And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch … know a thought with the mind. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart. And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is called a mendicant who is corrupt when it comes to sights known by the eye, sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts known by the mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them. If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a house made of reeds or straw that was dried up, withered, and decrepit. If a person came to it with a burning grass torch from the east, west, north, south, below, above, or from anywhere, the fire would find a vulnerability, it would get a foothold.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them. If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a mendicant lives like this, they’re mastered by sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts, they don’t master these things.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is called a mendicant who has been mastered by sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. They’re mastered, not a master. Bad, unskillful qualities have mastered them, which are defiled, leading to future lives, hurtful, and resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how someone is corrupt.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is someone uncorrupted?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it.

<p class="bodytext">That’s how someone is uncorrupted.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Moggallāna! It’s good that you’ve taught this explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said, and the teacher approved. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Mahāmoggallāna said.</p>

Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.

For that person knows, ‘If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that will result in my death or deadly pain.’</p>

The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’ When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, the strongest of them would get their way, and they’d all have to submit to their control.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye pulls towards pleasant sights, but is put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body … mind pulls towards pleasant thoughts, but is put off by unpleasant thoughts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is how someone is unrestrained.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is someone restrained?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch … know a thought with their mind. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a person was to catch six animals, with diverse territories and feeding grounds, and tie them up with a strong rope. They’d catch a snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal, and a monkey, tie each up with a strong rope, then tether them to a strong post or pillar.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those six animals with diverse domains and territories would each pull towards their own domain and territory. The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’ When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, they’d stand or sit or lie down right by that post or pillar.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye doesn’t pull towards pleasant sights, and isn’t put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body … mind doesn’t pull towards pleasant thoughts, and isn’t put off by unpleasant thoughts. This is how someone is restrained.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘A strong post or pillar’ is a term for mindfulness of the body.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this: ‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’ That’s how you should train.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">248. The Sheaf of Barley</h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, suppose a sheaf of barley was placed at a crossroads. Then six people would come along carrying flails, and started threshing the sheaf of barley. So that sheaf of barley would be thoroughly threshed by those six flails. Then a seventh person would come along carrying a flail, and they’d give the sheaf of barley a seventh threshing. So that sheaf of barley would be even more thoroughly threshed by that seventh flail.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, an uneducated ordinary person is struck in the eye by both pleasant and unpleasant sights. They’re struck in the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind by both pleasant and unpleasant thoughts. And if that uneducated ordinary person has intentions regarding rebirth into a new state of existence in the future, that foolish person is even more thoroughly struck, like that sheaf of barley threshed by the seventh person.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, addressed the demons, ‘My good sirs, if the demons defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the castle of demons.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, ‘My good sirs, if the gods defeat the demons in this battle, bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. So the gods of the Thirty-Three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakka’s presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And there Vepacitti remained bound by his limbs and neck. That is, until he thought, ‘It’s the gods who are principled, while the demons are unprincipled. Now I belong right here in the castle of the gods.’ Then he found himself freed from the bonds on his limbs and neck. He entertained himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But when he thought, ‘It’s the demons who are principled, while the gods are unprincipled. Now I will go over there to the castle of the demons,’ he found himself bound by his limbs and neck, and the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation disappeared.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how subtly Vepacitti was bound. But the bonds of Māra are even more subtle than that. When you identify, you’re bound by Māra. Not identifying, you’re free from the Wicked One.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are all forms of identifying: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Conceit is a disease, a boil, a dart. So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart that does not identify.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are all disturbances: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Disturbances are a disease, a boil, a dart. So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart free of disturbances.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are all tremblings: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Trembling is a disease, a boil, a dart. So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart free of tremblings.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are all proliferations: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Proliferation is a disease, a boil, a dart. So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart free of proliferation.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are all conceits: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Conceit is a disease, a boil, a dart.

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, an uneducated ordinary person feels pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings. An educated noble disciple also feels pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings. What, then, is the difference between an ordinary uneducated person and an educated noble disciple?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and pine and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. They experience two feelings: physical and mental.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s like a person who is struck with an arrow, only to be struck with a second arrow. That person experiences the feeling of two arrows.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and pine and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. They experience two feelings: physical and mental.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they’re touched by painful feeling, they resist it. The underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlies that.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When touched by painful feeling they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures. Why is that? Because an uneducated ordinary person doesn’t understand any escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures. Since they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, the underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlies that.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t truly understand feelings’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. The underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlies that.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it attached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it attached. If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it attached.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’re called an uneducated ordinary person who is attached to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or pine or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. They experience one feeling: physical, not mental.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s like a person who is struck with an arrow, but was not struck with a second arrow. That person would experience the feeling of one arrow.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or pine or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. They experience one feeling: physical, not mental.</p>

Since they don’t look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, there’s no underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlying that.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They truly understand feelings’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. There’s no underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlying that.</p>

So how could a pleasant feeling be permanent, since it has arisen dependent on a body that is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated?’ They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in the body and pleasant feeling.

<p class="bodytext">But the Buddha has also said: ‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’ What was the Buddha referring to when he said this?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, mendicant! I have spoken of these three feelings. Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. These are the three feelings I have spoken of.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But I have also said: ‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">When I said this I was referring to the impermanence of conditions, to the fact that conditions are liable to end, vanish, fade away, cease, and perish.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But I have also explained the progressive cessation of conditions. For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has ceased. For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have ceased. For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has ceased. For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite space, the perception of form has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite consciousness, the perception of the dimension of infinite space has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of nothingness, the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, the perception of the dimension of nothingness has ceased. For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased. For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have ceased.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And I have also explained the progressive stilling of conditions. For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has stilled. For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have stilled. … For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have stilled. For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have stilled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are these six levels of tranquility. For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has been tranquilized. For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have been tranquilized. For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has been tranquilized. For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has been tranquilized. For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have been tranquilized.

<p class="bodytext">“Master builder, the Buddha has spoken of three feelings: pleasant, painful, and neutral. The Buddha has spoken of these three feelings.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī, “Sir, Udāyī, the Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings. He’s spoken of two feelings: pleasant and painful. The Buddha said that neutral feeling is included as a peaceful and subtle kind of pleasure.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways. This being so, you can expect that those who do concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. What five? Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. … Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation. The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.

<p class="bodytext">“Sīvaka, some feelings stem from bile disorders. You can know this from your own personal experience, and it is generally agreed to be true.

<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘They speak of this thing called the “first absorption”. What is the first absorption?’ It occurred to me: ‘It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is called the first absorption.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so … I was entering and remaining in the first absorption. While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said, ‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don’t neglect the first absorption, brahmin! Settle your mind in the first absorption; unify your mind and immerse it in the first absorption.’</p>

<h3 class="subhead">1. The Fetter</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Now at that time, after the meal, on return from alms-round, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some senior mendicants answered like this: “Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But some senior mendicants answered like this: “Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ mean the same thing; they differ only in the phrasing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the householder Citta had arrived at Migapathaka on some business. He heard about what those senior mendicants were discussing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So he went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them, “Sirs, I heard that you were discussing whether the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ differ in both meaning and phrasing, or whether they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s right, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sirs, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Well then, sirs, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or yoke. Would it be right to say that the black ox is the yoke of the white ox, or the white ox is the yoke of the black ox?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, householder. The black ox is not the yoke of the white ox, nor is the white ox the yoke of the black ox. The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that they’re yoked by.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights the fetter of the eye. The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The ear … nose … tongue … body … mind is not the fetter of thoughts, nor are thoughts the fetter of the mind. The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to traverse the Buddha’s deep teachings with the eye of wisdom.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">2. Isidatta (1st)</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them, “Sirs, may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrow’s meal.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">They consented in silence. Knowing that the senior mendicants had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s home, and sat down on the seats spread out.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked the senior venerable, “Sir, they speak of ‘the diversity of elements’. In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the senior venerable kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time …</p>
<p class="bodytext">And for a third time, Citta asked him, “Sir, they speak of ‘the diversity of elements’. In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And a second time and a third time the senior venerable kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha. He said to the senior venerable, “Sir, may I answer Citta’s question?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Answer it, Reverend Isidatta.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, is this your question: ‘They speak of “the diversity of elements”. In what way did the Buddha speak of the diversity of elements?’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This is the diversity of elements spoken of by the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The eye element, the sights element, the eye consciousness element …</p>
<p class="bodytext">The mind element, the thought element, the mind consciousness element.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is how the Buddha spoke of the diversity of elements.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta, having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said, served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta, “Isidatta, it’s good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn’t. So when a similar question comes up, you should also answer it as you feel inspired.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them, “Sirs, may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrow’s meal.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s home, and sat down on the seats spread out.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So he went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the senior venerable:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, there are many different views that arise in the world. For example: the world is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. And also the sixty-two misconceptions spoken of in the Supreme Net Discourse. When what exists do these views come to be? When what doesn’t exist do these views not come to be?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the senior venerable kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time …</p>
<p class="bodytext">And for a third time, Citta said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, there are many different views that arise in the world. … When what exists do these views come to be? When what doesn’t exist do these views not come to be?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And a second time and a third time the senior venerable kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Isidatta was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha. He said to the senior venerable, “Sir, may I answer Citta’s question?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Answer it, Reverend Isidatta.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, is this your question: ‘There are many different views that arise in the world … When what exists do these views come to be? When what doesn’t exist do these views not come to be?’’ “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, there are many different views that arise in the world. For example: the world is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. And also the sixty-two misconceptions spoken of in the Supreme Net Discourse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These views come to be when identity view exists. When identity view does not exist they do not come to be.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, how does identity view come about?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how identity view comes about.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, how does identity view not come about?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They don’t regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how identity view does not come about.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, where has Venerable Isidatta come from?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I come from Avanti, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, there’s a friend of mine called Isidatta who I’ve never met. He’s gone forth from a good family in Avanti. Have you met him?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, where is that venerable now staying?” When he said this, Isidatta kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, are you that Isidatta?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I hope Venerable Isidatta is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa, for the Wild Mango Grove is lovely. I’ll make sure that Venerable Isidatta is provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s nice of you to say, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta, having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said, served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta, “Isidatta, it’s good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn’t. So when a similar question comes up, you should also answer it as you feel inspired.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But Isidatta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, left Macchikasaṇḍa, never to return.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">4. Mahaka’s Demonstration</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta the householder went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them, “Sirs, may the senior mendicants please accept my offering of tomorrow’s meal in my barn.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">They consented in silence. Then, knowing that the senior mendicants had consented, Citta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled them, keeping them on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s barn, and sat down on the seats spread out.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with delicious milk-rice made with ghee. When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left. Citta instructed that the remainder of the food be distributed, then followed behind the senior mendicants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the heat was sweltering. And those senior mendicants walked along as if their bodies were melting, as happens after a meal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Mahaka was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha. Then Venerable Mahaka said to the senior venerable, “Wouldn’t it be nice, sir, if a cool wind blew, a cloud canopy formed, and a gentle rain drizzled down?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It would indeed be nice, Reverend Mahaka.” Then Mahaka used his psychic power to will that a cool wind would blow, a cloud canopy would form, and a gentle rain would drizzle down.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta thought, “The most junior mendicant in this Saṅgha has such psychic power!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they reached the monastery, Mahaka said to the senior venerable, “Sir, is that sufficient?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s sufficient, Reverend Mahaka, you’ve done enough and offered enough.” Then the senior mendicants entered their dwellings, and Mahaka entered his own dwelling.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta went up to Mahaka, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, please show me a superhuman demonstration of psychic power.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, then, householder, place your upper robe on the porch and spread a handful of grass on it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Citta, and did as he was asked.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mahaka entered his dwelling and latched the door. Then he used his psychic power to will that a flame shoot out through the keyhole and the chink in the door, and it burned up the grass but not the upper robe. Then Citta shook out his upper robe and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mahaka left his dwelling and said to Citta, “Is that sufficient, householder?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s sufficient, sir, you’ve done enough and offered enough. I hope Venerable Mahaka is happy here in Macchikāsaṇḍa, for the Wild Mango Grove is lovely. I’ll make sure that Venerable Mahaka is provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s nice of you to say, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But Mahaka set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, left Macchikasaṇḍa, never to return.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">5. With Kāmabhū (1st)</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, bowed, and sat down to one side. Kāmabhū said to him, “Householder, there is this saying:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘With flawless wheel and white canopy,</p>
<p class="gatha">the one-spoke chariot rolls on.</p>
<p class="gatha">See it come, untroubled,</p>
<p class="gatha">with stream cut, unbound.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, was this spoken by the Buddha?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, sir, please wait a moment while I consider the meaning of this.” Then after a short silence Citta said to Kāmabhū:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, ‘flawless wheel’ is a term for ethics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘White canopy’ is a term for freedom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘One spoke’ is a term for mindfulness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Rolls on’ is a term for going forward and coming back.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Chariot’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Greed, hate, and delusion are troubles. A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future. That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called ‘untroubled’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘The one who comes’ is a term for the perfected one.</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Stream’ is a term for craving. A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given this up, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, and obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is said to have ‘cut the stream’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Greed, hate, and delusion are bonds. A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future. That’s why a mendicant who has ended the defilements is called ‘unbound’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, sir, that’s how I understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘With flawless wheel and white canopy,</p>
<p class="gatha">the one-spoke chariot rolls on.</p>
<p class="gatha">See it come, untroubled,</p>
<p class="gatha">with stream cut, unbound.’”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">6. With Kāmabhū (2nd)</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, how many processes are there?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, there are three processes. Physical, verbal, and mental processes.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, what is the physical process? What’s the verbal process? What’s the mental process?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and feeling mental processes?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Breathing is physical. It’s tied up with the body, that’s why breathing is a physical process. First you place the mind and keep it connected, then you break into speech. That’s why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental. They’re tied up with the mind, that’s why perception and feeling are mental processes.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think: ‘I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’ Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, which cease first for a mendicant who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Verbal processes cease first, then physical, then mental.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When someone dies, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled; their vitality is spent; their warmth is dissipated; and their faculties have disintegrated. When a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled. But their vitality is not spent; their warmth is not dissipated; and their faculties are very clear. That’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think: ‘I will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling.’ Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, which arise first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mental processes arise first, then physical, then verbal.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they experience?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“They experience three kinds of contact: emptiness, signless, and undirected contacts.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, what does their mind slant, slope, and incline to?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Saying “Good, sir,” Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, how many things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, householder, you’ve finally asked what you should have asked first! Nevertheless, I will answer you. Two things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling: serenity and discernment.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">7. With Godatta</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Godatta was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Godatta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Godatta said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, the limitless heart’s release, and the heart’s release through nothingness, and the heart’s release through emptiness, and the signless heart’s release: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, there is a way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing. But there’s also a way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what’s the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing?</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. This is called the limitless heart’s release.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the heart’s release through nothingness? It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. This is called the heart’s release through nothingness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the heart’s release through emptiness? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’ This is called the heart’s release through emptiness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the signless heart’s release? It’s when a mendicant, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. This is called the signless heart’s release.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what’s the way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Greed, hate, and delusion are makers of limits. A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future. The unshakable heart’s release is said to be the best kind of limitless heart’s release. That unshakable heart’s release is empty of greed, hate, and delusion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Greed is something, hate is something, and delusion is something. A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.

<h3 class="subhead">8. Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Citta the householder heard that they had arrived. Together with several lay followers, he went up to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him, “Householder, do you have faith in the ascetic Gotama’s claim that there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, in this case I don’t rely on faith in the Buddha’s claim that there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked up at his assembly and said, “See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all. To imagine that you can stop placing the mind and keeping it connected would be like imagining that you can catch the wind in a net, or dam the Ganges river with your own hand.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, sir? Which is better—knowledge or faith?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Knowledge is definitely better than faith, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well sir, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption. And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption. And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so, sir, since I know and see like this, why should I rely on faith in another ascetic or brahmin who claims that there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta looked askance at his own assembly and said, “See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, just now I understood you to say: ‘See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all.’ But then I understood you to say: ‘See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!’ If your first statement is true, the second is wrong. If your first statement is wrong, the second is true.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And also, sir, these ten legitimate questions are relevant. When you understand what they mean, then, together with your assembly of Jain ascetics, you can rebut me. ‘One thing: question, summary, and answer. Two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight … nine … ten things: question, summary, and answer.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta got up from his seat and left without asking Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta these ten legitimate questions.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">9. With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the naked ascetic Kassapa, who in lay life was an old friend of Citta, had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Citta the householder heard that he had arrived. So he went up to him, and they exchanged greetings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the naked ascetic Kassapa, “Sir, Kassapa, how long has it been since you went forth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s been thirty years, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I have no such achievement, householder, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Citta said to him, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing, how well explained the teaching is. For in thirty years you have achieved no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, no meditation at ease, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But householder, how long have you been a lay follower?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s been thirty years, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But householder, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“How, sir, could I not? For whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption. And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption. And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If I pass away before the Buddha, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Buddha declares of me: ‘The householder Citta is bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, Kassapa said to Citta, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing, how well explained the teaching is. For a white-clothed layperson can achieve such a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Citta the householder took the naked ascetic Kassapa to see the senior mendicants, and said to them:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sirs, this is the naked ascetic Kassapa, who in lay life was an old friend of mine. May the senior monks give him the going forth, the ordination. I’ll make sure that he’s provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">10. Seeing the Sick</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the householder Citta was sick, suffering, gravely ill.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees came together and said to Citta, “Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they said this, Citta said to them, “That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members said, “Be mindful, lord! Don’t babble.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What have I said that makes you say that?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s because you said: ‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Oh, well, that’s because the deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees said to me: ‘Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’ So I said to them: ‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what reason do they see for saying that to you?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“They think: ‘This householder Citta is ethical, of good character. If he makes a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future, his heart’s wish will succeed because of the purity of his ethics. And then as a proper, principled king he will provide proper spirit-offerings.’ That’s the reason they see for saying to me: ‘Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’ So I said to them: ‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then, lord, advise us!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So you should train like this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">We will have experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">We will have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">We will have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">And we will share without reservation all the gifts available to give in our family with those who are ethical and of good character.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then, after Citta had encouraged his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members in the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, and generosity, he passed away.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then the chief named Fury went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some people are regarded as furious, while others are regarded as sweet-natured?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Take someone who hasn’t given up greed. So they get annoyed by others, and they show it. They’re regarded as furious. They haven’t given up hate. So they get annoyed by others, and they show it. They’re regarded as furious. They haven’t given up delusion. So they get annoyed by others, and they show it. They’re regarded as furious.

<p class="bodytext">But take someone who has given up greed. So they don’t get annoyed by others, and don’t show it. They’re regarded as sweet-natured. They’ve given up hate.

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then Tāḷapuṭa the dancing master came up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said: ‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ What does the Buddha say about this?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time …</p>
<p class="bodytext">And for a third time Tāḷapuṭa said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said: ‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ What does the Buddha say about this?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Clearly, chief, I’m not getting through to you when I say: ‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’ Nevertheless, I will answer you.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When sentient beings are still not free of greed, and are still bound by greed, a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more arousing things. When sentient beings are still not free of hate, and are still bound by hate, a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more hateful things. When sentient beings are still not free of delusion, and are still bound by delusion, a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more delusory things. And so, being heedless and negligent themselves, they’ve encouraged others to be heedless and negligent. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the hell called ‘Laughter’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But if you have such a view: ‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ This is your wrong view. An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Tāḷapuṭa cried and burst out in tears.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said: ‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said. But sir, for a long time I’ve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers, who said: ‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">What do you think, chief? Take a person who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view. And a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating them with joined palms and saying: ‘When this person’s body breaks up, after death, may they be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm!’ What do you think, chief?

And a large crowd was to come together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating it with joined palms, and saying: ‘Rise, good rock! Float, good rock! Float to shore, good rock!’ What do you think, chief? Would that broad rock rise up or float because of their prayers?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Sir, doesn’t the Buddha live full of compassion for all living beings?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, chief.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, sir, why exactly do you teach some people thoroughly and others less thoroughly?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, chief, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think? Suppose a farmer has three fields: one’s good, one’s average, and one’s poor—bad ground of sand and salt. What do you think? When that farmer wants to plant seeds, where would he plant them first: the good field, the average one, or the poor one?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, he’d plant them first in the good field, then the average, then he may or may not plant seed in the poor field. Why is that? Because at least it can be fodder for the cattle.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To me, the monks and nuns are like the good field. I teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased.

<p class="bodytext">To me, the laymen and laywomen are like the average field.

Why is that? Because they live with me as their island, protection, shelter, and refuge.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief, who was a disciple of the Jains, went up to the Buddha, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Chief, how does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teach his disciples?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, this is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples: ‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steal, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell. You’re led on by what you usually live by.’ This is how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta teaches his disciples.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘You’re led on by what you usually live by’: if this were true, then, according to what Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says, no-one would go to a place of loss, to hell.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, chief? Take a person who kills living creatures. If we compare periods of time during the day and night, which is more frequent: the occasions when they’re killing or when they’re not killing?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The occasions when they’re killing are less frequent, while the occasions when they’re not killing are more frequent.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Take some teacher who has this doctrine and view: ‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steals, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell.’ And there’s a disciple who is devoted to that teacher. They think: ‘My teacher has this doctrine and view: ‘Everyone who kills a living creature, steals, commits sexual misconduct, or lies goes to a place of loss, to hell.’ But I’ve killed living creatures … stolen … committed sexual misconduct … or lied. They get the view: ‘I too am going to a place of loss, to hell.’ Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.</p>

In many ways he criticizes and denounces killing living creatures, saying: ‘Stop killing living creatures!’ He criticizes and denounces stealing … sexual misconduct … lying, saying: ‘Stop lying!’ And there’s a disciple who is devoted to that teacher. Then they reflect: ‘In many ways the Buddha criticizes and denounces killing living creatures, saying: “Stop killing living creatures!” But I have killed living creatures to a certain extent. That’s not right, it’s not good, and I feel remorseful because of it. But I can’t undo what I have done.’ Reflecting like this, they give up killing living creatures, and in future they don’t kill living creatures. That’s how to give up this bad deed and get past it.</p>

<p class="bodytext">They give up killing living creatures. They give up stealing. They give up sexual misconduct. They give up lying. They give up divisive speech. They give up harsh speech. They give up talking nonsense. They give up covetousness. They give up ill will and malevolence. They give up wrong view and have right view.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four directions. In the same way, when the heart’s release by love has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">9. Families</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at Nāḷandā. There he stayed near Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now that was a time of famine and scarcity in Nāḷandā, with blighted crops turned to straw. At that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics. Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief, who was a disciple of the Jains, went up to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Come, chief, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. Then you will get a good reputation: ‘Asibandhaka’s son the chief refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But sir, how am I to do this?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Here, brahmin, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him: ‘Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?’ When he’s asked this, if he answers: ‘Indeed I do, chief,’ say this to him: ‘So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw? The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’ When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” replied Asibandhaka’s son. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Indeed I do, chief.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw? The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, chief, I recollect ninety eons back but I’m not aware of any family that’s been ruined merely by offering some cooked alms-food. Rather, rich, affluent, and wealthy families—with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain—all acquired their wealth because of generosity, truth, and restraint.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Chief, there are eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families. Their ruin stems from rulers, bandits, fire, or flood. Or their savings vanish. Or their business fails due to not applying themselves to work. Or a wastrel is born into the family who squanders and fritters away their wealth. And impermanence is the eighth. These are the eight causes and conditions for the ruin of families.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Given that these eight reasons are found, suppose someone says this: ‘The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’ Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Asibandhaka’s son the chief said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">10. With Maṇicūḷaka</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time while the king’s retinue was sitting together in the royal compound this discussion came up among them, “Gold and money are proper for Sakyan ascetics. They accept and receive gold and money.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the chief Maṇicūḷaka was sitting in that assembly. He said to that retinue, “Good sirs, don’t say that. Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics. They neither accept nor receive gold and money. They have set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and money.” He was able to persuade that assembly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Maṇicūḷaka went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. He then said, “Answering this way, I trust that I repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. I trust my explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Indeed, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics. They neither accept nor receive gold and money. They have set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and money.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If gold and money were proper for them, then the five kinds of sensual stimulation would also be proper. And if the five kinds of sensual stimulation are proper for them, you should definitely regard them as not having the qualities of an ascetic or a follower of the Sakyan.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Rather, chief, I say this: Straw may be looked for by one needing straw; wood may be looked for by one needing wood; a cart may be looked for by one needing a cart; a workman may be looked for by one needing a workman. But I say that there is no way they can accept or look for gold and money.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">11. With Bhadraka</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town called Uruvelakappa. Then Bhadraka the village chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Please, sir, teach me the origin and cessation of suffering.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Chief, if I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the past, saying ‘this is how it was in the past,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that. If I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the future, saying ‘this is how it will be in the future,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that. Rather, chief, I will teach you about the origin and ending of suffering as I am sitting right here and you are sitting right there. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Bhadraka replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, chief? Are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who, if they were executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, it would cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There are, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who, if they were executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, it would not cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There are, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What’s the cause, chief, what’s the reason why, if this was to happen to some people it could cause you sorrow, while if it happens to others it does not?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The people regarding whom this would give rise to sorrow are those I desire and love. The people regarding whom this would not give rise to sorrow are those I don’t desire and love.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“With this present phenomenon that is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, you may infer to the past and future: ‘All the suffering that arose in the past was rooted and sourced in desire. For desire is the root of suffering. All the suffering that will arise in the future will be rooted and sourced in desire. For desire is the root of suffering.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How well said this was by the Buddha! ‘All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire. For desire is the root of suffering.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">I have a boy called Ciravāsi, who resides in a house away from here. I rise early and send someone, saying: ‘Go, my man, and check on my boy Ciravāsi.’ Until they get back I worry: ‘I hope nothing’s wrong with Ciravāsi!’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, chief? If Ciravāsi was executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, would it cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“How could it not, sir?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This too is a way to understand: ‘All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire. For desire is the root of suffering.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, chief? Before you’d seen or heard of Ciravāsi’s mother, did you have any desire or love or fondness for her?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then was it because you saw or heard of her that you had desire or love or fondness for her?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, chief? If Ciravāsi’s mother was executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, would it cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“How could it not, sir?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then Rāsiya the chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all forms of mortification. He categorically condemns and denounces those self-mortifiers who live rough.’ Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Chief, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false, hollow, and untrue.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth. Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is that middle way? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“No, sir. I’m quite different from the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses, we have quite different characters.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So if you can know those officers of bad character while you are not of bad character, why can’t the Realized One know magic, without being a magician?</p>

His head is shaven and he’s marched from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum.

<p class="bodytext">One teacher had this doctrine and view: ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There are no duties to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">One teacher had this doctrine and view: ‘Nothing bad is done by the doer when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. Nothing bad is done when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit. In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">I had doubt and uncertainty about that: ‘I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth, and who speaks falsehood?’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Chief, no wonder you’re doubting and uncertain. Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Chief, there is immersion based on understanding of principle. If you gain such mental immersion, you can give up that cause of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is immersion based on understanding of principle? It’s when a noble disciple has given up killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, talking nonsense, covetousness, ill will, and wrong view.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that noble disciple is rid of desire, rid of ill will, unconfused, aware, and mindful. They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They reflect thus: ‘That teacher who had this doctrine and view: “There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.

And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.” If what this good teacher says is true, it’s a safe bet for me to not hurt any creature firm or frail. I win on both counts, since I’m restrained in body, speech, and mind, and when my body breaks up, after death, I’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Joy springs up in them. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. This is that immersion based on understanding of principle. If you gain such mental immersion, you can give up that state of uncertainty.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then King Pasenadi addressed a man, “Please, mister, check if there’s a suitable ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu to whom I can pay homage.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied that man. He searched all over Toraṇavatthu, but he couldn’t see a suitable ascetic or brahmin for the king to pay homage to.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But he saw that the nun Khemā was staying there, so he went to the king and said to him, “Your Majesty, there’s no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu for the king to pay homage to. But there is the nun Khemā, who’s a disciple of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. She has a good reputation as being astute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, and eloquent. Your Majesty may pay homage to her.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the nun Khemā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ma’am, does a Realized One exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Great king, this has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, does a Realized One not exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ma’am, when asked these questions, you say that this has not been declared by the Buddha. What’s the cause, what’s the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, great king, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, great king?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the grains of sand in the Ganges, that is, how many grains of sand there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of grains of sand?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the water in the ocean, that is, how many gallons of water there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of gallons of water?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, ma’am. Why is that? Because the ocean is deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, great king, any form by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom, like the ocean. To say that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist: none of these apply.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Any feeling … perception … choices … consciousness by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.

To say that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist: none of these apply.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the nun Khemā said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then on a later occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He asked the Buddha exactly the same questions he had asked the nun Khemā, and received the same answers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He said, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without contradiction when it comes to the chief matter! This one time I went to the nun Khemā and asked her about this matter. And she explained it to me with these words and phrases, just like the Buddha. It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without contradiction when it comes to the chief matter!</p>
<p class="bodytext">Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before leaving.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">2. With Anurādha</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the wanderers said to him, “This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.” Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seat and left.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought, “If those wanderers were to inquire further, how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Anurādha? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So, Anurādha, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ Any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as form?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you regard the Realized One as feeling … perception … choices … consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as in form?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling … or distinct from feeling … as in perception … or distinct from perception … as in choices … or distinct from choices … as in consciousness … or as distinct from consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In that case, Anurādha, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare: ‘Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Anurādha! In the past, as today, what I describe is suffering and the cessation of suffering.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, a few days ago several ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers who follow various other paths were sitting together in the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them: ‘This Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. When a disciple passes away, he declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. And as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he also declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This Makkhali Gosāla … Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta … Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta … Pakudha Kaccāyana … Ajita Kesakambala leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. When a disciple passes away, he declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. And as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he also declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This ascetic Gotama leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. When a disciple passes away, he declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he doesn’t declare that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. Rather, he declares that they have cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of suffering. I had doubt and uncertainty about that: ‘How on earth can I understand the ascetic Gotama’s teaching?’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Vaccha, no wonder you’re doubting and uncertain. Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel. It’s like a fire which only burns with fuel, not without fuel. In the same way I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But when a flame is blown away by the wind, what do you say is its fuel then?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“At such a time, I say that it’s fueled by wind. For the wind is its fuel then.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But when someone who is attached has laid down this body and has not been reborn in one of the realms, what does Master Gotama say is their fuel then?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When someone who is attached has laid down this body, Vaccha, and has not been reborn in one of the realms, I say they’re fueled by craving. For craving is their fuel then.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, when Vacchagotta asked me whether the self exists absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self exists absolutely’ I would have been siding with the ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists. When Vacchagotta asked me whether the self does not exist absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self does not exist absolutely’ I would have been siding with the ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationists.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When Vacchagotta asked me whether the self exists absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self exists absolutely’ would that have helped give rise to the knowledge that all things are not-self?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When Vacchagotta asked me whether the self does not exist absolutely, if I had answered that ‘the self does not exist absolutely’, Vacchagotta—who is already confused—would have got even more confused, thinking: ‘It seems that the self that I once had no longer exists.’”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">11. With Sabhiya Kaccāna</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Sabhiya Kaccāna was staying at Nādika in the brick house. Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to him, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to Sabhiya Kaccāna:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Kaccāna, does a Realized One exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Vaccha, this has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, does a Realized One not exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Kaccāna, when asked these questions, you say that this has not been declared by the Buddha. What’s the cause, what’s the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In order to describe him as ‘possessing form’ or ‘formless’ or ‘percipient’ or ‘non-percipient’ or ‘neither percipient nor non-percipient’, there must be some cause or reason for doing so. But if that cause and reason were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over, how could you describe him in any such terms?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Kaccāna, how long has it been since you went forth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not long, reverend: three years.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, you’ve learned a lot already, let alone what lies ahead!”</p>
