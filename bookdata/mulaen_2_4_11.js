<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.1 : What’s the Purpose? </h3>
<p class="bodytext"> So I have heard.  At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, what’s the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, having no regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of having no regrets?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Joy is the purpose and benefit of having no regrets.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of joy?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Rapture …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of rapture?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Tranquility …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of tranquility?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Bliss …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of bliss?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Immersion …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of immersion?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Truly knowing and seeing …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Disillusionment …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of disillusionment?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Dispassion …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what’s the purpose and benefit of dispassion?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of dispassion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So, Ānanda, the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics is not having regrets. Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets. Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy. Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture. Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility. Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss. Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion. Disillusionment is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Dispassion is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment. And knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of dispassion. So, Ānanda, skillful ethics progressively lead up to the highest.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.2 : Making a Wish </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, an ethical person, who has fulfilled ethical conduct, need not make a wish: ‘May I have no regrets!’ It’s only natural that an ethical person has no regrets.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you have no regrets you need not make a wish: ‘May I feel joy!’ It’s only natural that joy springs up when you have no regrets.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you feel joy you need not make a wish: ‘May I experience rapture!’ It’s only natural that rapture arises when you’re joyful.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When your mind is full of rapture you need not make a wish: ‘May my body become tranquil!’ It’s only natural that your body becomes tranquil when your mind is full of rapture.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When your body is tranquil you need not make a wish: ‘May I feel bliss!’ It’s only natural to feel bliss when your body is tranquil.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you feel bliss you need not make a wish: ‘May my mind be immersed in samādhi!’ It’s only natural for the mind to become immersed in samādhi when you feel bliss.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When your mind is immersed in samādhi you need not make a wish: ‘May I truly know and see!’ It’s only natural to truly know and see when your mind is immersed in samādhi.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you truly know and see you need not make a wish: ‘May I grow disillusioned!’ It’s only natural to grow disillusioned when you truly know and see.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you’re disillusioned you need not make a wish: ‘May I become dispassionate!’ It’s only natural to grow dispassionate when you’re disillusioned.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you’re dispassionate you need not make a wish: ‘May I realize the knowledge and vision of freedom!’ It’s only natural to realize the knowledge and vision of freedom when you’re dispassionate.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so, mendicants, the knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of dispassion. Dispassion is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment. Disillusionment is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion. Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss. Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility. Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture. Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy. Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets. Not having regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics. And so, mendicants, good qualities flow on and fill up from one to the other, for going from the near shore to the far shore.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.3 : Vital Conditions (1st) </h3>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, any mendicant who abuses and insults their spiritual companions, speaking ill of the noble ones, will, without a doubt, fall into one or other of these eleven disasters. What eleven?</p>
<p class="bodytext">They don’t achieve the unachieved. What they have achieved falls away. They don’t refine their good qualities. They overestimate their good qualities. Or they live the spiritual life dissatisfied. Or they commit a corrupt offense. Or they reject the training and return to a lesser life. Or they contract a severe illness. Or they go mad and lose their mind. They feel lost when they die. And when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.7 : Percipient </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Could it be, sir, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It could be, Ānanda, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But how could this be, sir?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant perceives: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then Ānanda approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Could it be, reverend Sāriputta, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth … And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It could be, Reverend Ānanda.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But how could this be?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant perceives: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’ That’s how a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth … And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. And yet they would still perceive.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without conflict when it comes to the chief matter! Just now I went to the Buddha and asked him about this matter. And the Buddha explained it to me in this manner, with these words and phrases, just like Venerable Sāriputta. It’s incredible, it’s amazing! How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without conflict when it comes to the chief matter!”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.8 : Awareness </h3>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Could it be, sir, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t be aware of the eye or sights, ear or sounds, nose or smells, tongue or tastes, or body or touches. They wouldn’t be aware of earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t be aware of the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t be aware of this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t be aware of what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. Yet they would be aware?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It could be, Ānanda.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But how could this be?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant is aware: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">That’s how a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this.

Yet they would be aware.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.9 : With Sandha </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Sandha went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sandha, meditate like a thoroughbred, not like a wild colt.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a wild colt meditate? A wild colt, tied up by the feeding trough, meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it doesn’t occur to the wild colt tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied up by the feeding trough they just meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, take a certain wild person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. Their heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. Harboring sensual desire within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate. Their heart is overcome by ill will … dullness and drowsiness … restlessness and remorse … doubt … Harboring doubt within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate. They meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. They meditate dependent on the dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. They meditate dependent on this world or the other world. They meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. That’s how a wild colt meditates.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a thoroughbred meditate? A fine thoroughbred, tied up by the feeding trough, doesn’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it occurs to the fine thoroughbred tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied up by the feeding trough they don’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ For that fine thoroughbred regards the use of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, a misfortune.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, take a certain fine thoroughbred person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. Their heart is not overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. Their heart is not overcome by ill will … dullness and drowsiness … restlessness and remorse … doubt … They don’t meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. They don’t meditate dependent on the dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. They don’t meditate dependent on this world or the other world. They don’t meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. Yet they do meditate.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a fine thoroughbred meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and Pajāpati worship them from afar:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred! </p>
<p class="gatha">Homage to you, supreme among men! </p>
<p class="gatha">We don’t understand </p>
<p class="gatha">the basis of your absorption.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Venerable Sandha asked the Buddha, “But sir, how does that fine thoroughbred meditate?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sandha, for a fine thoroughbred person, the perception of earth has vanished in relation to earth. The perception of water … fire … air has vanished in relation to air. The perception of the dimension of infinite space has vanished in relation to the dimension of infinite space. The perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness … nothingness … neither perception nor non-perception has vanished in relation to the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. The perception of this world has vanished in relation to this world. The perception of the other world has vanished in relation to the other world. And the perception of what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind has vanished. That’s how that fine thoroughbred person doesn’t meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. They don’t meditate dependent on the dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. They don’t meditate dependent on this world or the other world. They don’t meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. Yet they do meditate.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.10 : At the Peacocks’ Feeding Ground </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a mendicant who has three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. What three? The entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics, immersion, and wisdom. A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant who has another three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. What three? A demonstration of psychic power, a demonstration of revealing, and a demonstration of instruction. A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant who has another three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. What three? Right view, right knowledge, and right freedom. A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant who has two qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. What two? Knowledge and conduct. A mendicant with these two qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘The aristocrat is best of those people </p>
<p class="gatha">who take clan as the standard. </p>
<p class="gatha">But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct </p>
<p class="gatha">is best of gods and humans.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, that verse spoken by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s beneficial, not pointless, and I agree with it. I also say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘The aristocrat is best of those people </p>
<p class="gatha">who take clan as the standard. </p>
<p class="gatha">But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct </p>
<p class="gatha">Is best of gods and humans.’”</p></div>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.11 : With Mahānāma (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I have heard that several mendicants are making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.

<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Mahānāma! It’s appropriate that gentlemen such as you come to me and ask: ‘We spend our life in various ways. Which of these should we practice?’ The faithful succeed, not the faithless. The energetic succeed, not the lazy. The mindful succeed, not the unmindful. Those with immersion succeed, not those without immersion. The wise succeed, not the witless.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you’re grounded on these five things, go on to develop six further things.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, you should recollect the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the Realized One. A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds joy in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching. When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, you should recollect the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ When a noble disciple recollects the teaching their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of the teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, you should recollect the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own ethical conduct, which is unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. When a noble disciple recollects their ethical conduct their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of their ethical conduct.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, you should recollect your own generosity: ‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate. Among people with hearts full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’ When a noble disciple recollects their own generosity their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of generosity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, you should recollect the deities: ‘There are the Gods of the Four Great Kings, the Gods of the Thirty-Three, the Gods of Yama, the Joyful Gods, the Gods Who Love to Create, the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, the Gods of Brahmā’s Host, and gods even higher than these. When those deities passed away from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’ When a noble disciple recollects the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and the deities their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the deities. A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds joy in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching. When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of the deities.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.12 : With Mahānāma (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Now at that time Mahānāma the Sakyan had recently recovered from an illness. At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.13 : With Nandiya </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the Buddha wanted to commence the rains residence at Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nandiya the Sakyan heard about this, and thought, “Why don’t I also commence the rains residence at Sāvatthī. There I can apply myself to my work and from time to time get to see the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the Buddha commenced the rains residence in Sāvatthī, and so did Nandiya. There he applied himself to his work and from time to time got to see the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nandiya the Sakyan heard about this. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I have heard that several mendicants are making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. Now, we spend our life in various ways. Which of these should we practice?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good Nandiya! It’s appropriate that gentlemen such as you come to me and ask: ‘We spend our life in various ways. Which of these should we practice?’ The faithful succeed, not the faithless. The ethical succeed, not the unethical. The energetic succeed, not the lazy. The mindful succeed, not the unmindful. Those with immersion succeed, not those without immersion. The wise succeed, not the witless. When you’re grounded on these six things, go on to develop five further things.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Firstly, you should recollect the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the Realized One.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, you should recollect the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, you should recollect your good friends: ‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate, to have good friends who advise and instruct me out of kindness and compassion.’ In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on good friends.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, you should recollect your own generosity: ‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate. Among people with hearts full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’ In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on generosity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, you should recollect the deities: ‘There are deities who, surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food, are reborn in a certain host of mind-made deities. They don’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement.’ An irreversibly freed mendicant doesn’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement. In the same way, Nandiya, there are deities who, surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food, are reborn in a certain host of mind-made deities. They don’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement. In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the deities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A noble disciple who has these eleven qualities gives up bad, unskillful qualities and doesn’t cling to them. It’s like when a pot full of water is tipped over, so the water drains out and doesn’t go back in. Suppose there was an uncontrolled fire. It advances burning up dry woodlands and doesn’t go back over what it has burned. In the same way, a noble disciple who has these eleven qualities gives up bad, unskillful qualities and doesn’t cling to them.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.14 : With Subhūti </h3>
<p class="bodytext">And then Venerable Subhūti together with the mendicant Saddha went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Subhūti, what is the name of this mendicant?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, the name of this mendicant is Saddha. He is the son of the layman Saddha, and has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, I hope this mendicant Saddha exhibits the outcomes of faith.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha to speak on the outcomes of faith. Now I will find out whether or not this mendicant Saddha exhibits the outcomes of faith.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, Subhūti, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” Subhūti replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. When a mendicant is ethical, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. When a mendicant is learned, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. When a mendicant has good friends, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re patient, and take instruction respectfully. When a mendicant is easy to admonish, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant is deft and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, understanding how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work. When a mendicant is skilled and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant loves the teachings and is a delight to converse with, being full of joy in the teaching and training. When a mendicant loves the teachings, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. When a mendicant is energetic, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. When a mendicant gets the four absorptions, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. When a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. When a mendicant has clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, this is an outcome of faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. When a mendicant has ended the defilements, this is an outcome of faith.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Venerable Subhūti said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, the outcomes of faith for a faithful person that the Buddha speaks of are found in this mendicant; he does exhibit them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant is ethical …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant is learned …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant has good friends …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant is easy to admonish …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant is skilled and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant loves the teachings …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant is energetic …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant gets the four absorptions …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant recollects their many kinds of past lives …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant has clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human …</p>
<p class="bodytext">This mendicant has ended the defilements …</p>
<p class="bodytext">The outcomes of faith for a faithful person that the Buddha speaks of are found in this mendicant; he does exhibit them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Subhūti! So, Subhūti, you should live together with this mendicant Saddha. And when you want to see the Realized One, you should come together with him.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.15 : The Benefits of Love </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, you can expect eleven benefits when the heart’s release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What eleven? You sleep well. You wake happily. You don’t have bad dreams. Humans love you. Non-humans love you. Deities protect you. You can’t be harmed by fire, poison, or blade. Your mind quickly enters immersion. Your face is clear and bright. You don’t feel lost when you die. If you don’t penetrate any higher, you’ll be reborn in a Brahmā realm. You can expect eleven benefits when the heart’s release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.16 : The Man From the City of Aṭṭhaka </h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the householder Dasama from the city of Aṭṭhaka had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business. He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain mendicant, and said to him, “Sir, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying? For I want to see him.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, householder.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what is that one thing?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. Then they reflect: ‘Even this first absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. Then they reflect: ‘Even this fourth absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Then they reflect: ‘Even this heart’s release by love is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion … They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Then they reflect: ‘Even this heart’s release by equanimity is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. Then they reflect: ‘Even this attainment of the dimension of infinite space is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. … Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. … Then they reflect: ‘Even this attainment of the dimension of nothingness is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they reach the supreme sanctuary.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the householder Dasama said to Venerable Ānanda:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, suppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure. And all at once they’d come across eleven entrances! In the same way, I was searching for the door to the deathless. And all at once I got to hear of eleven doors to the deathless. Suppose a person had a house with eleven doors. If the house caught fire they’d be able to flee to safety through any one of those doors. In the same way, I’m able to flee to safety through any one of these eleven doors to the deathless. Sir, those who follow other paths seek a fee for the teacher. Why shouldn’t I make an offering to Venerable Ānanda?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the householder Dasama, having assembled the Saṅgha from Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta, served and satisfied them with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. He clothed each and every mendicant in a pair of garments, with a set of three robes for Ānanda. And he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for Ānanda.</p>
<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.17 : The Cowherd </h3>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a cowherd with eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle. What eleven? It’s when a cowherd doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t smoke out pests, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in pastures, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. A cowherd with these eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, a mendicant with eleven qualities can’t achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training. What eleven? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t smoke out pests, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in pastures, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant not know form? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand that all form is the four primary elements, or form derived from the four primary elements. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know form.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is a mendicant not skilled in characteristics? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t understand that a fool is characterized by their deeds, and an astute person is characterized by their deeds. That’s how a mendicant isn’t skilled in characteristics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant not pick out flies’ eggs? It’s when a mendicant tolerates a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They don’t give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it. They tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen. They don’t give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant not dress wounds? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they get caught up in the features and details. Since the faculty of sight is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion become overwhelming. They don’t practice restraint, they don’t protect the faculty of sight, and they don’t achieve its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they get caught up in the features and details. Since the faculty of the mind is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion become overwhelming. They don’t practice restraint, they don’t protect the faculty of the mind, and they don’t achieve its restraint. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t dress wounds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant not smoke out pests? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t teach others the Dhamma in detail as they learned and memorized it. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t smoke out pests.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant not know the ford? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t from time to time go up to those mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the texts on monastic training, and the outlines—and ask them questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those venerables don’t clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know the ford.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant not know satisfaction? It’s when a mendicant, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, finds no joy in the meaning and the teaching, and finds no joy connected with the teaching. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know satisfaction.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant not know the trail? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand the noble eightfold path. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know the trail.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is a mendicant not skilled in pastures? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. That’s how a mendicant is not skilled in pastures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant milk dry? It’s when a mendicant is invited by a householder to accept robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But they don’t know moderation in accepting. That’s how a mendicant milks dry.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant not show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t consistently treat senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A mendicant with these eleven qualities can’t achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A cowherd with eleven factors can maintain and expand a herd of cattle. What eleven? It’s when a cowherd knows form, is skilled in characteristics, picks out flies’ eggs, dresses wounds, smokes out pests, knows the ford, knows satisfaction, knows the trail, is skilled in pastures, doesn’t milk dry, and shows extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. A cowherd with these eleven factors can maintain and expand a herd of cattle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, a mendicant with eleven qualities can achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training. What eleven? It’s when a mendicant knows form, is skilled in characteristics, picks out flies’ eggs, dresses wounds, smokes out pests, knows the ford, knows satisfaction, knows the trail, is skilled in pastures, doesn’t milk dry, and shows extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant know form? It’s when a mendicant truly understands that all form is the four primary elements, or form derived from the four primary elements. That’s how a mendicant knows form.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how is a mendicant skilled in characteristics? It’s when a mendicant understands that a fool is characterized by their deeds, and an astute person is characterized by their deeds. That’s how a mendicant is skilled in characteristics.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant pick out flies’ eggs? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and exterminates it. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. That’s how a mendicant picks out flies’ eggs.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant dress wounds? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. That’s how a mendicant dresses wounds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant smoke out pests? It’s when a mendicant teaches others the Dhamma in detail as they learned and memorized it. That’s how a mendicant smokes out pests.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant know the ford? It’s when from time to time a mendicant goes up to those mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the texts on monastic training, and the outlines—and asks them questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. That’s how a mendicant knows the ford.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant know satisfaction? It’s when a mendicant, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, finds joy in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching. That’s how a mendicant knows satisfaction.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how does a mendicant know the trail? It’s when a mendicant truly understands the noble eightfold path. That’s how a mendicant knows the trail.</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.18 : Immersion (1st) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">And then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Could it be, sir, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air. And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind.

<p class="bodytext">“It’s when a mendicant perceives: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’ That’s how a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this. They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air.

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.19 : Immersion (2nd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

<h3 class="subhead"> AN 11.20 : Immersion (3rd) </h3>
<p class="bodytext">And then several mendicants went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Could it be, reverend, that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this? They wouldn’t perceive earth in earth, water in water, fire in fire, or air in air.

<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, friend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this:</p>
