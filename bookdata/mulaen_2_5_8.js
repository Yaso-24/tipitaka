<p class="gatha"> Will wander about, insolent, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Like cantankerous beasts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’ll be arrogant, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Wrapped in robes of blue; </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">The impure one </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Who will wear the ochre robe </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">In the future, monks and nuns </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> When the latter days have come.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Before this terrifying future arrives, </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> Free of deceit, disciplined, without envy, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The sage has realised the state of peace, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Since he has realized <i>nibbāna</i>, he awaits his time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Abandon conceit, Gotama! </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Completely abandon the path to conceit; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Infatuated with the path to conceit, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> You’ve had regrets for a long time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Smeared by smears and slain by conceit, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> People fall into hell. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They grieve for a long time.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But a monk never grieves </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> If they practice rightly, a victor of the path. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> They have renown and happiness, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> And they rightly call him a ‘Seer of Dhamma’.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So don’t be hard-hearted, be energetic, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> With hindrances abandoned, purified, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> And with conceit abandoned completely, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Be at peace, and use knowledge to make an end.”</p>

<p class="gatha"> My mind is on fire! </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">“Your mind is on fire </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Because of a perversion of perception. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Avoid noticing the attractive aspect of things </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">Meditate on the signless, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Throw out the underlying tendency to conceit, </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> You will live at peace.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Speak only such words </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> Realists say that the Dhamma and its meaning </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Are grounded in the truth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The reliable words spoken by the Buddha </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> For realizing <i>nibbāna</i>, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> And making an end of suffering: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> This really is the best kind of speech.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“His understanding is profound, he is wise, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> He is skilled in knowing the path and what is not the path; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Sāriputta, of great understanding, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Teaches Dhamma to the monks.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He teaches in brief, </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">He has explained in many ways </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The path to cross the flood. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Since the deathless has been explained, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The seers of Dhamma stand unshakable.</p>

<p class="gatha"> For the benefit of the many </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Men and women </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Who follow their teachings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Truly, it is for their benefit </p end="">

<p class="gatha"> Of things which are shared, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> I encountered the best.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I’ve realised the perfection of direct knowledge; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> I have supernormal hearing; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> I have the three knowledges and psychic powers, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> I’m skilled at reading the minds of others.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I ask the teacher unrivalled in understanding, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Who has cut off all doubts in this very life— </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Has a monk died at Aggāḷava, who was </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Well-known, famous, and attained to <i>nibbāna</i>?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nigrodhakappa was his name; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> It was given to that brahman by you, Blessed One. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Yearning for freedom, energetic, firmly seeing the Dhamma, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> He wandered in your honor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">O Sakyan, who sees all around, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> All of us wish to know about that disciple. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Our ears are eager to hear, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> For you’re truly the most excellent teacher.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Cut off our doubt, declare this to us; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Your understanding is vast, tell us of his <i>nibbāna</i>! </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> You see all around, so speak among us, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Like the thousand-eyed Sakka in the assembly of the gods!</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whatever ties there are, or paths to delusion, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Or things that are on the side of unknowing, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Or that are bases of doubt: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> When it comes to the Tathāgata there are none; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Among people, his eye is the best.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For if no man were ever to disperse defilements, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Like the wind dispersing a mass of clouds, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Darkness would cover the whole world, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> And even a lamp would not shine.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The wise are makers of light; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> My hero, that is what I think of you. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> We’ve come to you for your insight and knowledge: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Here in this assembly, declare to us about Kappāyana.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Swiftly send forth your sweet voice, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Like a goose stretching its neck, gently honking, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The sound is smooth, with a lovely tone: </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Alert, we are all listening to you.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You have entirely abandoned birth and death; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Restrained and pure, speak the Dhamma! </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Unenlightened people can’t fulfil all their wishes, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> But Tathāgatas can achieve what they intend.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Your answer is definitive, and we will accept it, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> For you have perfect understanding. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> We raise our hands in <i>añjalī</i> one last time, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Your understanding is unrivalled, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> So do not knowingly confuse us.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Knowing the noble Dhamma from top to bottom, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Your energy is unrivalled, so do not knowingly confuse us. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Like a man in the baking summer sun would long for water, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> I long for the rain of your voice to fall on my ears.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Surely Kappāyana </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Did not live the spiritual life in vain? </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Did he realise <i>nibbāna</i>, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Or did he still have a remnant of defilement? </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Let us hear what kind of liberation he had!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He cut off craving for mind and body in this very life, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The river of darkness that had long lain within him. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> He has entirely crossed over birth and death.” </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> So declared the Blessed One, the leader of the five.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now that I have heard your words, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Best of sages, I am confident. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> My question, it seems, was not in vain, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The brahman did not deceive me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As he spoke, so he acted; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> He was a disciple of the Buddha. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> He cut the net of death the illusionist, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> So extended and strong.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Blessed One, Kappāyana saw </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> The starting point of grasping. </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> He has gone beyond the realm of death, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> So very hard to cross.</p>
<p class="bodytext">God of gods, best of men, I bow to you; </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> And to your son, </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> Who follows your example, a great hero </p end="">
<p class="gatha"> An elephant, true son of an elephant.”</p></div>
