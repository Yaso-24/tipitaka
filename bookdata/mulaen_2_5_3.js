<p class="bodytext">Then with the passing of those seven days, the Gracious One, after arising from that concentration, for the last watch of the night, applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse order:</p>

Then with the passing of those seven days, the Gracious One arose from that concentration.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain brāhmaṇa who was by nature a grumbler went to the Gracious One, and after going, he exchanged greetings with the Gracious One. After exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he stood on one side. While stood on one side that brāhmaṇa said this to the Gracious One:</p>

<p class="bodytext">The Gracious One saw those venerable ones coming while still far away, and having seen them, he addressed the monks saying: “These brāhmaṇas are coming, monks; these brāhmaṇas are coming, monks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, a certain monk who was a brāhmaṇa by birth, said to the Gracious One: “To what extent, dear Gotama, is one a brāhmaṇa? And again what things make one a brāhmaṇa?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Mahākassapa at another time arose from that affliction. Then this occured to venerable Mahākassapa when he arose from that affliction: “Well now, I should enter Rājagaha for alms.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then at that time five hundred devatās were ready and eager to offer almsfood to venerable Mahākassapa. But venerable Mahākassapa, after refusing those five hundred devatās, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms, going to the poor streets, to the wretched streets, to the weaver’s streets.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Gracious One saw venerable Mahākassapa walking for alms in Rājagaha, going to the poor streets, to the wretched streets, to the weaver’s streets. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then the Flock of Goats yakkha desiring to give rise to fear, terror, and horror in the Gracious One, went to the Gracious One, and after going, not far away from the Gracious One three times he called out:</p>

<p class="bodytext">Venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife heard: “Master Saṅgāmajī it seems has arrived at Sāvatthī”, and taking her little boy she went to Jeta’s Wood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then at that time venerable Saṅgāmajī was dwelling for the day sat at the root of a certain tree. Then venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife went to venerable Saṅgāmajī, and after going, she said to venerable Saṅgāmajī: “I have a little son, ascetic, you must take care of me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent.</p>

<p class="bodytext">For a third time venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife, having put the boy down in front of venerable Saṅgāmajī, went away, saying: “This is your son, ascetic, you must take care of him.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But venerable Saṅgāmajī did not look at the boy, nor did he speak to him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife having gone not far away, looking round saw that venerable Saṅgāmajī was neither looking at the boy, nor was he speaking to him. Having seen that this occured to her: “This ascetic does not even have need of a son.” Therefore, after turning back and taking the boy, she went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Gracious One saw with the divine-eye which is purified, and surpasses that of normalmen, that venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife had such bad manners. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In her coming he does not rejoice, in her leaving he does not grieve,</p end="">

<p class="bodytext">The Gracious One saw that those many knotted-haired ascetics, in the Winter nights, in between ‘the eights’, at the time of the snowfall, in the Gayā river, were plunging out and plunging in, were plunging out and in, were sprinkling water, and were offering the fire sacrifice, thinking: “Through this there is purity.”</p>

<h2 class="title">The Discourse about Bāhiya</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time Bāhiya of the Bark Robe was living near Suppāraka, on the bank of the ocean, being venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then when Bāhiya of the Bark Robe had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: “Among those in the world who are Worthy Ones, or have entered the path to Worthiness, I am one of them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a devatā, who was a former blood-relative of Bāhiya of the Bark Robe, being compassionate and desiring his welfare, knowing with his mind the reflection in the mind of Bāhiya of the Bark Robe, went to Bāhiya of the Bark Robe, and after going, he said this to Bāhiya of the Bark Robe:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You are certainly not a Worthy One, Bāhiya. Nor have you entered the path to Worthiness. This practice of yours is not one whereby you could be a Worthy One, or one who has entered the path to Worthiness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then who now in this world with its devas are Worthy Ones, or have entered the path to Worthiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There is, Bāhiya, in the northern countries a city by the name of Sāvatthī. There the Gracious One dwells at the present time who is a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha. He, Bāhiya, the Gracious One, is certainly a Worthy One, and teaches the Dhamma for attainingWorthiness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Bāhiya of the Bark Robe being greatly moved by that devatā, immediately went away from Suppāraka, and staying for only one night in every place, went to Sāvatthī, Jeta’s Wood, and to Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time many monks were walking in meditation in the open air. Then Bāhiya of the Bark Robe went to those monks, and after going, he said this to those monks:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Where, reverend Sirs, is the Gracious One living at present, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha? We have a desire to see the Gracious One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The Gracious One, Bāhiya, has entered among the houses for alms.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Bāhiya of the Bark Robe having hurriedly left Jeta’s Grove and having entered Sāvatthī, saw the Gracious One walking for alms in Sāvatthī, confident, inspiring confidence, with sense faculties at peace, mind at peace, having attained supreme self-control and calm, controlled, guarded, with restrained faculties, a true nāga. After seeing him, he went to the Gracious One, and after going and prostrating himself with his head at the Gracious One’s feet, he said this to the Gracious One: “Let the Gracious One preach the Dhamma to me, reverend Sir, let the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma, that will be for my benefit and happiness for a long time.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, the Gracious One said this to Bāhiya of the Bark Robe: “It is the wrong time for you, Bāhiya, we have entered among the houses for alms.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time Bāhiya of the Bark Robe said this to the Gracious One: “But it is hard to know, reverend Sir, the dangers to the Gracious One’s life, or the dangers to my life! Let the Gracious One preach the Dhamma to me, reverend Sir, let the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma, that will be for my benefit and happiness for a long time.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time the Gracious One said this to Bāhiya of the Bark Robe: “It is the wrong time for you, Bāhiya, we have entered among the houses for alms.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time Bāhiya of the Bark Robe said this to the Gracious One: “But it is hard to know, reverend Sir, the dangers to the Gracious One’s life, or the dangers to my life! Let the Gracious One preach the Dhamma to me, reverend Sir, let the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma, that will be for my benefit and happiness for a long time.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In that case, Bāhiya, you should train yourself thus: In what is seen there must be only what is seen, in what is heard there must be only what is heard, in what is sensed there must be only what is sensed, in what is cognized there must be only what is cognized. This is the way, Bāhiya, you should train yourself.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And since for you, Bāhiya, in what is seen there will be only what is seen, in what is heard there will be only what is heard, in what is sensed there will be only what is sensed, in what is cognized there will be only what is cognized, therefore, Bāhiya, you will not be with that; and since, Bāhiya, you will not be with that, therefore, Bāhiya, you will not be in that; and since, Bāhiya, you will not be in that, therefore, Bāhiya, you will not be here or hereafter or in between the two—just this is the end of suffering.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then through the Gracious One’s brief teaching of this Dhamma Bāhiya of the Bark Robe’s mind was immediately freed from the pollutants, without attachment. Then the Gracious One, having advised Bāhiya of the Bark Robe with this brief advice, went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then not long after the Gracious One had gone a cow with a young calf, having attacked Bāhiya of the Bark Robe, deprived him of life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One after walking for alms in Sāvatthī, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, after going out from the city with many monks, saw that Bāhiya of the Bark Robe had died. After seeing him, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Monks, take up Bāhiya of the Bark Robe’s body, and after putting it on a bier, carrying it away, and burning it, make a memorial mound for him, your fellow in the spiritual life, monks, has died.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir,” said those monks, and after replying to the Gracious One, putting Bāhiya of the Bark Robe’s body on a bier, carrying it away, burning it, and making a memorial mound for him, they went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One: “Burnt, reverend Sir, is Bāhiya of the Bark Robe’s body, and the memorial mound for him has been made. What is his destination? What is his future state?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“A wise man, monks, was Bāhiya of the Bark Robe, who practiced Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, and did not trouble me on account of the Dhamma. Completely emancipated, monks, is Bāhiya of the Bark Robe.” Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the place where the water, earth, fire, and wind find no footing,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">There the stars do not shine, nor does the sun give light,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">There the moon does not glow, there darkness is not found.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And when the sage, the brāhmaṇa, has experienced nibbāna through his own sagacity,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Then from both form and formless, happiness and suffering, he is free.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">This exalted utterance was also said by the Gracious One, so I have heard.</p></div>

Then at that time the Gracious One was sitting in one cross-legged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then at that time a great cloud arose out of season, bringing seven days of rainy weather, cold winds, and overcast days. Then the Nāga King Mucalinda, after leaving his domicile, and surrounding the Gracious One’s body seven times with his coils, stood with his great hood stretched out above his head, thinking:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“May the Gracious One not be cold, may the Gracious One not be hot, may the Gracious One not be affected by gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the heat of the sun, and serpents.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then with the passing of those seven days, the Gracious One arose from that concentration. Then the Nāga King Mucalinda, having understood that the sky was now clear without a cloud, having unravelled his coils from the Gracious One’s body, and after withdrawing his own form, and creating the appearance of a young brāhmaṇa, stood in front of the Gracious One, revering the Gracious One with raised hands.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="bodytext">Now this conversation amongst those monks was left unfinished. Then the Gracious One, having risen from seclusion in the evening time, went to the assembly hall, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat. Having sat down the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is the talk about, monks, amongst those who have assembled together and are sitting here at present, and what is the conversation that you left unfinished?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“This is certainly not suitable, monks, for you sons of good family who through faith have gone forth from the home to homelessness, that you should talk such talk. When you have assembled together, monks, there are two things that you ought to do: talk about the Dhamma, or maintain noble silence.”</p>

Then at that time the Gracious One was venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, and in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick; also the Community of monks was venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, and in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick. But wanderers from other sects were not venerated, not respected, not revered, not honoured, not esteemed, nor were they in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those wanderers from other sects, being unable to bear the veneration of the Gracious One and the Community of monks, after seeing the monks in the village or the wilderness, with vulgar and rough words scolded, abused, annoyed, and troubled them. Then many monks went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“At present, reverend Sir, the Gracious One is venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, and in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick; also the Community of monks is venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, and in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick.

Then it occured to that wanderer: “At the Kosalan King Pasenadi’s storehouse to an ascetic or brāhmaṇa as much ghee or oil as is necessary is being given to drink, but not to carry away. Well now, after going to the Kosalan King Pasenadi’s storehouse, drinking as much of the oil as is necessary, returning to the house, and throwing it up, I could give it to her, and that can be used for her delivery.”</p>

Then at that time the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā was with child for seven years, and for seven days it was lost in the womb and couldn’t be delivered. While she was affected by painful, sharp, harsh, and bitter feelings, she consented to three thoughts: “For sure the Gracious One is a Perfect Sambuddha, who teaches the Dhamma for the giving up of suffering such as this; for sure the Gracious One’s Community of disciples are good in their practice, who practice for the giving up of suffering such as this; it is sure that Emancipation is truly happy, where suffering such as this is not found.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā addressed her husband, saying: “Come, Master, you must go to the Gracious One, and after going, in my name you should worship the Gracious One’s feet with your head, and ask if he is free from affliction, free from sickness, in good health, strong, and living comfortably, and say: ‘The Koliyan lady Suppavāsā, reverend Sir, worships the Gracious One’s feet with her head, and asks if you are free from affliction, free from sickness, in good health, strong, and living comfortably?’ And please say this: ‘The Koliyan lady Suppavāsā, reverend Sir, has been with child for seven years, and for seven days it has been lost in the womb.

<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Nanda, at his monk-friends’ words about a hireling, words about a lackey, was distressed, ashamed, and disgusted, and while dwelling solitary, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, after no long time attained that good for which sons of good family rightly go forth from the home to homelessness, that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life, and dwelt having known, having directly experienced, and having attained nibbāna himself in this very life:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Destroyed is birth accomplished is the spiritual life done is what ought to be done there is no more of this mundane state”—this he knew.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And venerable Nanda became another of the Worthy Ones.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain devatā, when the night had passed, having lit up the whole of Jeta’s Wood with his surpassing beauty, went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he stood on one side. While standing on one side that devatā said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable Nanda, reverend Sir, the Gracious One’s brother, his mother’s sister’s son, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom, dwells having known, having directly experienced, and having attained nibbānahimself in this very life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And this knowledge arose to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Nanda, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom, dwells having known, having directly experienced, and having attained nibbāna himself in this very life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Nanda, when that night had passed, went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Nanda said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That, reverend Sir, for which the Gracious One was my surety—for gaining five hundred celestial dove-footed nymphs—I free the Gracious One, reverend Sir, from that promise.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Nanda, having encompassed your mind fully with my mind, I understood: ‘Nanda, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom, dwells having known, having directly experienced, and having attained nibbāna himself in this very life.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Also a devatā announced that matter to me, saying: ‘Venerable Nanda, reverend Sir, the Gracious One’s brother, his mother’s sister’s son, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom, dwells having known, having directly experienced, and having attained nibbāna himself in this very life.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When, Nanda, your mind was freed from the pollutants without attachment, then was I freed from that promise.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time five hundred monks with Yasoja at their head had arrived in Sāvatthī, to see the Gracious One. Then those visiting monks while exchanging greetings with the resident monks, having the dwelling places assigned, putting the bowls and robes in order, made a loud noise, a great noise.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: “Who are these making a loud noise, a great noise? One would think it is fishermen with their haul of fish!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“These, reverend Sir, are five hundred monks with Yasoja at their head, who have arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Gracious One. These visiting monks while exchanging greetings with the resident monks, having the dwelling places assigned, putting the bowls and robes in order, make a loud noise, a great noise.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now then, Ānanda, with my word address those monks, saying: ‘The Teacher calls the venerable ones.’ ”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, he went to those monks, and after going, he said this to those monks: “The Teacher calls the venerable ones.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, friend,” said those monks, and after replying to venerable Ānanda, they went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side the Gracious One said this to those monks:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Why, monks, are you making a loud noise, a great noise, so one would think it is fishermen with their haul of fish?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, venerable Yasoja said this to the Gracious One: “These, reverend Sir, are five hundred monks who have arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Gracious One. These visiting monks while exchanging greetings with the resident monks, having the dwelling places assigned, putting the bowls and robes in order, make a loud noise, a great noise.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Please go, monks, I am dismissing you. You should not live in my presence.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir,” said those monks, and after replying to the Gracious One, rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, putting their dwelling places in order, picking up their robes and bowls, they went on walking tour towards Vajji. While walking gradually through Vajji on walking tour they went to the river Vaggumudā, and after going and making leaf-huts on the bank of the river Vaggumudā, they entered upon the Rains Retreat.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Yasoja, having entered upon the Rains Retreat, addressed those monks saying: “We were dismissed, friends, by the Gracious One, who desires our welfare, who seeks our benefit, who is compassionate, out of compassion for us. Well now, venerable friends, we must live in such a way that the Gracious One will be pleased with our living.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, friend,” those monks replied to venerable Yasoja. Then those monks while dwelling secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, within the Rains Retreat all realized the three deep understandings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having dwelt at Sāvatthī for as long as he wished, went on walking tour towards Vesālī, and while walking gradually on walking tour he arrived at Vesālī. There the Gracious One dwelt near Vesālī, in the Great Wood, at the Gabled Hall. Then the Gracious One, having applied his mind, and with his mind fully encompassed the minds of the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā, addressed venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It is as though something light has arisen for me, Ānanda, in this direction. It is as though something splendid has arisen for me, Ānanda, in this direction. To go to that direction where the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā dwell and to apply my mind is not disagreeable. Please send, Ānanda, a messenger into the presence of the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā, to say: ‘The Teacher, venerable friends, calls you, the Teacher desires to see the venerable ones.’ ”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, he went to a certain monk, and after going, he said this to that monk: “Come, venerable friend, you should go to the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā, and after going, please say this to the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā: ‘The Teacher, venerable friends, calls you, the Teacher desires to see the venerable ones.’ ”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, friend,” said that monk, and after replying to venerable Ānanda, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, in the same way did he disappear from the Gabled Hall in Great Wood, and reappear in front of those monks on the bank of the river Vaggumudā. Then that monk said this to the monks on the bank of the Vaggumudā: “The Teacher, venerable friends, calls you, the Teacher desires to see the venerable ones.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, friend,” said those monks, and after replying to that monk, setting their dwelling places in order, and picking up their bowls and robes, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, in the same way did they disappear from the bank of the river Vaggumudā, and reappear in front of the Gracious One in the Gabled Hall in Great Wood.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then it occured to those monks: “The Gracious One is dwelling in a state of imperturbability at the present time,” and they all sat in imperturbable concentration.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Ānanda, when the night had passed, when the first watch of the night had gone, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The night has passed, reverend Sir, the first watch of the night has gone, for a long time these visiting monks have been sitting, let the Gracious One exchange greetings, reverend Sir, with the visiting monks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When that was said, the Gracious One was silent.</p>

<h2 class="title">The Discourse about Meghiya</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Cālikā, on the Cālikā mountain. Then at that time venerable Meghiya was the Gracious One’s attendent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Meghiya went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he stood on one side. While stood on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Gracious One: “Reverend Sir, I want to enter Jantugāma for alms.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now is the time for whatever you are thinking, Meghiya.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Meghiya having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Jantugāma for alms. Having walked for alms in Jantugāma, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, he went to the bank of the river Kimikālā Black-Worm River, and after going to the bank of the river Kimikālā, while wandering around and strolling around on a walk, he saw a pleasing and delightful mango grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Having seen it, this occured to him: “This is surely a pleasing and delightful mango grove. For a son of a good family who needs to strive this is surely enough for striving. If the Gracious One would allow me I could come to this mango grove for striving.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Meghiya went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Here, reverend Sir, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up my bowl and robe, I entered Jantugāma for alms. Having walked for alms in Jantugāma, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, I went to the bank of the river Kimikālā, and after going to the bank of the river Kimikālā, while wandering around and strolling around on a walk, I saw a pleasing and delightful mango grove.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Having seen it, this occured to me: ‘This is surely a pleasing and delightful mango grove. For a son of a good family who needs to strive this is surely enough for striving. If the Gracious One would allow me, I could come to this mango grove for striving.’ If the Gracious One would allow me, reverend Sir, I could go to that mango grove for striving.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When that was said, the Gracious One said this to venerable Meghiya: “You should wait for as long as I am alone, Meghiya, until some other monk arrives.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time venerable Meghiya said this to the Gracious One: “There is nothing further for the Gracious One to do, reverend Sir, there is nothing to add to what has been done. But for me, reverend Sir, there is something further to do, there is something to add to what has been done. If the Gracious One would allow me, reverend Sir, I could go to that mango grove for striving.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time the Gracious One said this to venerable Meghiya: “You should wait for as long as I am alone, Meghiya, until some other monk arrives.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time venerable Meghiya said this to the Gracious One: “There is nothing further for the Gracious One to do, reverend Sir, there is nothing to add to what has been done. But for me, reverend Sir, there is something further to do, there is something to add to what has been done. If the Gracious One would allow me, reverend Sir, I could go to that mango grove for striving.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“When you are talking about striving, Meghiya, what can we say? Now is the time for whatever you are thinking, Meghiya.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Meghiya, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went to that mango grove, and after going and entering that mango grove, he sat down to dwell for the day at the root of a certain tree.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then to venerable Meghiya, as he was dwelling in that mango grove, for the most part only three bad, unwholesome thoughts occured, that is to say: the thought of sensual pleasure, the thought of ill-will, the thought of harming.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occured to venerable Meghiya: “Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, that I who, out of faith, have gone forth from the home to homelessness, should then be ensnared by these three bad, unwholesome thoughts, that is to say: by the thought of sensual pleasure, by the thought of ill-will, by the thought of harming.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Meghiya, having risen from seclusion in the evening time, went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Here, reverend Sir, as I was dwelling in that mango grove, for the most part only three bad, unwholesome thoughts occured, that is to say: the thought of sensual pleasure, the thought of ill-will, the thought of harming.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then, reverend Sir, it occured to me: ‘Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, that I who, out of faith, have gone forth from the home to homelessness, should then be ensnared by these three bad, unwholesome thoughts, that is to say: by the thought of sensual pleasure, by the thought of ill-will, by the thought of harming.’ ”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, there are five things that lead to maturity. What five?</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Here, Meghiya, a monk has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the first thing that leads to maturity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk is virtuous, he lives restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint, and is endowed with suitable conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, he trains in the training rules he has undertaken. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the second thing that leads to maturity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk has talk about what is very austere, that is suitable for opening up the mind, and that leads to absolute disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, deep knowledge, complete Awakening and Emancipation, such as: talk on wanting little, talk on being satisfied, talk on complete seclusion, talk on disassociation, talk on arousing energy, talk on virtue, talk on concentration, talk on wisdom, talk on freedom, talk on knowing and seeing freedom. Such talk as this he gains as he desires, he gains without difficulty, gains without trouble. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the third thing that leads to maturity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk dwells with energy aroused for the giving up of unwholesome things, for the taking up of wholesome things, steadfast, of firm endeavour, one who has not thrown off the burden in regard to wholesome things. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the fourth thing that leads to maturity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk is wise, he is endowed with wisdom that leads to seeing rise and disappearance, with noble penetration, that leads to the complete destruction of suffering. For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, this is the fifth thing that leads to maturity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, these five things leads to maturity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It can be expected, Meghiya, that for a monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, that he will be virtuous, that he will live restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint, and will be endowed with suitable conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest fault, and will train in the training rules he has undertaken.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It can be expected, Meghiya, that for a monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, that he will have talk that is very austere, that is suitable for opening up the mind, and that leads to absolute disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, deep knowledge, complete Awakening and Emancipation, such as: talk on wanting little, talk on being satisfied, talk on complete seclusion, talk on disassociation, talk on stirring up energy, talk on virtue, talk on concentration, talk on wisdom, talk on freedom, talk on knowing and seeing freedom. Such talk as this he gains as he desires, he gains without difficulty, gains without trouble.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It can be expected, Meghiya, that for a monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, that he will be a monk with energy aroused for the giving up of unwholesome things, for the taking up of wholesome things, steadfast, of firm endeavour, one who has not thrown off the burden in regard to wholesome things.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It can be expected, Meghiya, that for a monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, that he will be wise, endowed with wisdom that leads to seeing rise and disappearance, with noble penetration, that leads to the complete destruction of suffering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then, Meghiya, with a monk who is established in these five things, four further things ought be be developed:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The meditation on the unattractive should be developed for the giving up of passion, friendliness meditation should be developed for the giving up of ill-will, mindfulness of breathing should be developed for the cutting off of thoughts, the perception of impermanence should be developed for the complete uprooting of the conceit ‘I am’. To one who has the perception of impermanence, Meghiya, the perception of non-self is established, one who perceives non-self reaches the complete uprooting of the conceit ‘I am’, in this very life reaches Emancipation.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There are low thoughts, fine thoughts,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Together with elation in the mind,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Not having understood these thoughts of the mind,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">The unsteady mind runs here and there.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Having understood these thoughts of the mind,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">He who is ardent, mindful, restrains them. </p end="">
<p class="gatha">Also elations that have not arisen in the mind—</p end="">
<p class="gatha">An Awakened one has given these up completely.”</p>

<h2 class="title">The Discourse about Agitation</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Kusinārā, at Upavattana, in the Mallas’ Sāl Wood. Then at that time many monks were dwelling in a little forest hut not far from the Gracious One, agitated, arrogant, fickle, garrulous, of loose speech, unmindful, not fully understanding, uncomposed, with minds very unsteady, and with faculties uncontrolled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Gracious One saw those many monks dwelling in a little forest hut not far away, agitated, arrogant, fickle, garrulous, of loose speech, unmindful, not fully understanding, uncomposed, with minds very unsteady, and with faculties uncontrolled. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Through unprotected body, and through attainment of wrong view,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Through being overcome by sloth and torpor one goes under the power of Māra.</p>

<h2 class="title">The Discourse about the Cowherd</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was walking on walking tour amongst the Kosalans, together with a great Community of monks. Then the Gracious One, having gone down from the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then a certain cowherd went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side the Gracious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered that cowherd with a Dhamma talk.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that cowherd, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a Dhamma talk, said to the Gracious One: “May the Gracious One consent, reverend Sir, to me offering him a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence. Then that cowherd, having understood the Gracious One’s consent, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then with the passing of that night, that cowherd, in his own residence, having had an abundance of rich milk-rice and fresh ghee made ready, announced the time to the Gracious One, saying: “It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, went to that cowherd’s residence, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then that cowherd with his own hand, served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head with rich milk-rice and fresh ghee.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that cowherd, when the Gracious One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, having taken a low seat, sat down on one side. While sat on one side the Gracious One, after instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering that cowherd with a Dhamma talk, having risen from the seat, went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then not long after the Gracious One had gone, while between the boundaries of the villages, a certain man deprived that cowherd of life. Then many monks went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Today, reverend Sir, the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head, was served and satisfied by a cowherd with rich milk-rice and fresh ghee, now it seems that cowherd, reverend Sir, while between the boundaries of the villages, was deprived of life by a certain man.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Whatever an enemy might do to an enemy, or a foe to a foe, A wrongly directed mind may do more harm to him than that.”</p>

<h2 class="title">The Discourse about Moonlight</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Wood, at the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. Then at that time venerable Sāriputta and venerable Mahāmoggallāna were living at the Pigeon Vale. Then at that time venerable Sāriputta, on a moonlight night, with his hair freshly shaved off, was sitting in the open air, having attained a certain concentration.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then at that time two yakkha friends were going from the Northern region to the Southern region, with some business or other. Those yakkhas saw venerable Sāriputta, on thatmoonlight night, with his hair freshly shaved off, sat in the open air.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And after seeing him, one of those yakkhas said this to the second yakkha: “It occurs to me, friend, to give a blow on this ascetic’s head.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When that was said, that yakkha said this to the other yakkha: “Enough, friend, don’t strike the ascetic. Eminent is the ascetic, friend, of great power, of great majesty.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time that yakkha said this to the other yakkha: “It occurs to me, friend, to give a blow on this ascetic’s head.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time that yakkha said this to the other yakkha: “Enough, friend, don’t strike the ascetic. Eminent is the ascetic, friend, of great power, of great majesty.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time that yakkha said this to the other yakkha: “It occurs to me, friend, to give a blow on this ascetic’s head.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time that yakkha said this to the other yakkha: “Enough, friend, don’t strike the ascetic. Eminent is the ascetic, friend, of great power, of great majesty.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the yakkha taking no notice of that other yakkha, gave a blow on the elder venerable Sāriputta’s head: it was such a great blow that with that blow a seven, or seven and a half cubit Nāga elephant might have been felled, or a great mountain top might have been burst open.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that yakkha calling out: “I'm burning, I'm burning” right there and then fell into the Great Hell.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Venerable Mahāmoggallāna saw with his divine-eye, which is purified, and surpasses that of normal men, that yakkha giving a blow on venerable Sāriputta’s head. And after seeing it, he went to venerable Sāriputta, and after going, he said this to venerable Sāriputta: “Can you bear up, venerable friend? Can you carry on? Do you have any pain?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I can bear up, friend Moggallāna; I can carry on, friend Moggallāna, but I have a little pain on my head.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Wonderful, friend Sāriputta, marvellous, friend Sāriputta, such is the venerable Sāriputta’s great power and great majesty. Here, friend Sāriputta, a certain yakkha gave a blow on your head: it was such a great blow, that with that blow a seven, or seven and a half cubit Nāga elephant might have been felled, or a great mountain top might have been burst open. But then venerable Sāriputta said this: ‘I can bear up, friend Moggallāna; I can carry on, friend Moggallāna, but I have a little pain on my head.’ ”</p>

<p class="bodytext">The Gracious One heard with his divine ear-element, which is purified, and surpasses that of normal men, the fitting talk and conversation of these two Great Nāgas. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<h2 class="title">The Discourse about the Nāga Elephant</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then at that time the Gracious One was living beset by monks, and nuns, and male lay followers, and female lay followers, and kings, and king’s ministers, and sectarians, and sectarians’ disciples, he lived beset, unhappy, and uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occured to the Gracious One: “At present I am living beset by monks, and nuns, and male lay followers, and female lay followers, and kings, and king’s ministers, and sectarians, and sectarians’ disciples, I am living beset, unhappy, and uncomfortable. Well now, I could dwell solitary, secluded from the group.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms. After walking for alms in Kosambī, when he had returned from the alms-round after the meal, after putting the dwelling place in order by himself, picking up his robe and bowl, without having addressed his attendants, without having taken leave of the Community of monks, solitary, without a companion, went away on a walk towards Pārileyyaka. While walking gradually on walking tour he arrived at Pārileyyaka. There the Gracious One dwelt near Pārileyyaka, in the Protected Jungle, at the root of the auspicious Sāl-tree.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now also a certain Nāga elephant was living beset by male elephants, by female elephants, by young elephants, by baby elephants. He ate grass that had the tips broken off, while they ate what he had broken down from the branches. He drank water that had been disturbed, and when he arose from the bathing place female elephants went along jostling his body, he lived beset, unhappy, and uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to that Nāga elephant: At present I am living beset by male elephants, by female elephants, by young elephants, by baby elephants.

<p class="bodytext">Then that Nāga elephant, having gone away from the herd, went to Pārileyyaka, the Protected Jungle, the root of the auspicious Sāl-tree, and to the Gracious One. There, in that place where the Gracious One dwelt, that Nāga elephant, cleared that place of grass, and with his trunk provided the Gracious One with drinking water and washing water.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then when the Gracious One had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Formerly, I was living beset by monks, and nuns, and male lay followers, and female lay followers, and kings, and king’s ministers, and sectarians, and sectarians’ disciples, I was living beset, unhappy, and uncomfortable. However at present I am living unbeset by monks, and nuns, and male lay followers, and female lay followers, and kings, and king’s ministers, and sectarians, and sectarians’ disciples, I am living unbeset, happily, and comfortable.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Also to that Nāga elephant this reflection arose in his mind:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Formerly I was living beset by male elephants, by female elephants, by young elephants, by baby elephants. I ate grass that had the tips broken off, while they ate what I had broken down from the branches. I drank water that has been disturbed, and when I arose from my bathing place female elephants proceded to jostle me with their bodies, I was living beset, unhappy, uncomfortable. However at present I am living unbeset by male elephants, by female elephants, by young elephants, by baby elephants. I eat the unbroken tips of grass, while they do not eat what I have broken down from the branches. I drink water that has not been disturbed, and when I arise from my bathing place female elephants do not proceed to jostle me with their bodies, I am living unbeset, happily, and comfortable.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood his own complete seclusion, and knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in that Nāga elephant’s mind, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

Then at that time the Gracious One was venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, and in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick; also the Community of monks was venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, and in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick. But wanderers from other sects were not venerated, not respected, not revered, not honoured, not esteemed, nor were they in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those wanderers from other sects being unable to bear the veneration of the Gracious One and the Community of monks, went to the female wanderer Sundarī Beautiful, and after going, they said this to the female wanderer Sundarī: “Sister, what would you venture to do for your kinsmens’ welfare?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What can I do, Masters, what am I unable to do? I have given up my life for my kinsmens’ welfare.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then, sister, you must frequently go to Jeta’s Wood.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, Masters”, said the female wanderer Sundarī, and after replying to those wanderers from other sects, she frequently went to Jeta’s Wood. When those wanderers from other sects knew: “The female wanderer Sundarī has been seen by many people frequently going to Jeta’s Wood”, then having deprived her of life, and buried her into a trench-pit right there in Jeta’s Wood, they went to the Kosalan King Pasenadi, and after going, they said this to the Kosalan King Pasenadi:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Great King, we no longer see the female wanderer Sundarī.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But where do you suspect she is?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In Jeta’s Wood, Great King.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then you must search Jeta’s Wood.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those wanderers from other sects after searching Jeta’s Wood, lifting the body up from the trench-pit where it had been buried, putting it on a bier, and entering Sāvatthī, going from road to road, from cross-roads to cross-roads, made people find fault, saying:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“See, Masters, what the Sakyan ascetics have done, shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, lacking in virtue, of bad character, speakers of what is false, not living the spiritual life. But they will claim that they live by Dhamma, live in peace, live spiritually, speak the truth, are virtuous, and are of good character. They have no asceticism, they have no spirituality, their asceticism has perished, their spirituality has perished. Where is their asceticism? Where is their spirituality? They have gone away from asceticism, they have gone away from spirituality. For what man, having done what a man can do, would deprive a woman of life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That at that time, the people in Sāvatthī, after seeing the monks, with vulgar and rough words scolded, abused, annoyed, and troubled them, saying: “Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, lacking in virtue, of bad character, speakers of what is false, not living the spiritual life. But they will claim that they live by Dhamma, live in peace, live spiritually, speak the truth, are virtuous, and are of good character. They have no asceticism, they have no spirituality, their asceticism has perished, their spirituality has perished. Where is their asceticism? Where is their spirituality? They have gone away from asceticism, they have gone away from spirituality. For what man, having done what a man can do, would deprive a woman of life?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then many monks, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms, and after walking for alms in Sāvatthī, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“At present, reverend Sir, the people in Sāvatthī, after seeing the monks, with vulgar and rough words scold, abuse, annoy, and trouble them, saying: ‘Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, lacking in virtue, of bad character, speakers of what is false, not living the spiritual life. But they will claim that they live by Dhamma, live in peace, live spiritually, speak the truth, are virtuous, and are of good character. They have no asceticism, they have no spirituality, their asceticism has perished, their spirituality has perished. Where is their asceticism? Where is their spirituality? They have gone away from asceticism, they have gone away from spirituality. For what man, having done what a man can do, would deprive a woman of life?’ ”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This noise will not last long, monks, it will last for only seven days, and with the passing of seven days it will disappear. So, monks, when those people, after seeing the monks, with vulgar and rough words scold, abuse, annoy, and trouble them, you should reprove them with this verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He who speaks what is untrue goes to the nether regions,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Also he who says ‘I did not do’ what he has done,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Both of those men who have performed base deeds</p end="">
<p class="gatha">are the same when they have passed away, in the other world.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those monks, having mastered that verse in the presence of the Gracious One, when those people, after seeing the monks, with vulgar and rough words scolded, abused, annoyed, and troubled them, reproved them with this verse:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He who speaks what is untrue goes to the nether regions,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Also he who says ‘I did not do’ what he has done,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Both of those men who have performed base deeds</p end="">
<p class="gatha">are the same when they have passed away, in the other world.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then this occurred to those people: “These Sakyan ascetics are not the doers, this wasn’t done by them, these Sakyan ascetics are asserting the truth.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That noise did not last long, it only lasted for seven days, and with the passing of seven days it disappeared.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then many monks went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One: “It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, how well spoken that was, reverend Sir, by the Gracious One: ‘This noise will not last long, monks, it will last for only seven days, and with the passing of seven days it will disappear.’ That noise, reverend Sir, has disappeared.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Unrestrained the people pierce others with words,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Like they pierce an elephant with arrows in a battle, </p end="">

<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Wood, at the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. Then at that time the leper known as Suppabuddha Wide Awake was in Rājagaha, a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable man.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then at that time the Gracious One was sitting teaching Dhamma surrounded by a great assembly. The leper Suppabuddha saw while still far away that great crowd of people assembled together. Having seen that, this occurred to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Undoubtedly in this place some comestibles and edibles will be distributed. Well now, I could go to that great crowd of people, perhaps I will get some comestibles or edibles in this place.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the leper Suppabuddha went to that great crowd of people. The leper Suppabuddha saw the Gracious One sat teaching Dhamma surrounded by a great assembly. Having seen that, this occurred to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Here there are no comestibles or edibles being distributed, this ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma to the assembly. Perhaps I also could hear the Dhamma”, and he sat down right there and then, thinking: “I will also listen to the Dhamma.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of that assembly with his mind, thinking: “Who here is able to understand the Dhamma?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Gracious One saw the leper Suppabuddha sat in that assembly, and having seen him, this occurred to him: “This one here is able to understand the Dhamma”, and having regard to the leper Suppabuddha he related a gradual talk, that is to say: talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on heaven, the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual desires, and the advantages in renunciation—these he explained. When the Gracious One knew that the leper Suppabuddha was of ready mind, malleable mind, unhindered mind, uplifted mind, trusting mind, then he explained the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves: suffering, origination, cessation, path.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain would take the dye well, so to the leper Suppabuddha on that very seat, the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose: “Whatever has the nature of arising, all that has the nature of ceasing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the leper Suppabuddha having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts, attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, after rising from his seat went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down at one side. While he was sitting on one side the leper Suppabuddha said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Excellent, reverend Sir! Excellent reverend Sir! Just as, reverend Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that those with vision can see forms, just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Gracious One in countless ways. I go, reverend Sir, to the Gracious One for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. Please bear it in mind, reverend Gotama, that I am a lay follower who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered the leper Suppabuddha with a Dhamma talk, and after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Gracious One, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, he went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then not long after the leper Suppabuddha had gone a cow with a young calf having attacked him, deprived him of life. Then many monks went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That leper called Suppabuddha, reverend Sir, who was instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a Dhamma talk—he has died. What is his destination? What is his future state?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“A wise man, monks, was Suppabuddha, who practiced Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, and did not trouble me on account of the Dhamma. The leper Suppabuddha, monks, through the destruction of three fetters, is a stream-enterer, not subject to the fall, and is assured of arriving at Full Awakening.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When that was said, a certain monk said this to the Gracious One: “What was the reason, reverend Sir, what was the cause, through which the leper Suppabuddha became a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable man?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Formerly, monks, the leper Suppabuddha was a son of a wealthy merchant in this very Rājagaha. While going to his pleasure park he saw the Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikkhī entering the city for alms, and having seen him, this occurred to him: “Who is this leper roaming around with his leper’s robe?” And having spat, and circumambulated him disrespectfully on the left side, he went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As a result of that deed of his for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years, he boiled in the nether regions. And as a result of the remaining part of that deed of his he became a leper in this very Rājagaha, a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable man.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But he came to the Dhamma and Discipline taught by the Realised One, and obtained faith, obtained virtue, obtained learning, obtained liberality, obtained wisdom. After coming to the Dhamma and Discipline taught by the Realised One, and obtaining faith, obtaining virtue, obtaining learning, obtaining liberality, obtaining wisdom, at the break up of the body, after death, he arose in a fortunate destiny, in the world of Heaven, in the companionship of the Tāvatiṃsa devas. And there he surely outshines the other devas with his beauty and repute.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="bodytext">“The assembly is not completely pure, Ānanda.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to venerable Mahāmoggallāna: “With regard to which person did the Gracious One say this: ‘The assembly is not completely pure, Ānanda’? ” Then venerable Mahāmoggallāna applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of that Community of monks with his mind.

<h2 class="title">The Discourse about Soṇa</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Mahākaccāyana was dwelling amongst the Avanti people, near Kuraraghara, on Pavatta mountain. Then at that time the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa was venerable Mahākaccāyana’s supporter.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then when the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: “According to the way Master Mahākaccāyana teaches the Dhamma, it is not easy, while dwelling in the home, to live the spiritual life, absolutely fulfilled, absolutely pure, like a polished shell. Well now, after shaving off head-hair and beard, and donning ochre clothes, I could go forth from the home to homelessness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa went to venerable Mahākaccāyana, and after going and worshipping venerable Mahākaccāyana, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa said this to venerable Mahākaccāyana: “Here, reverend Sir, having gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in my mind: ‘According to the way Master Mahākaccāyana teaches the Dhamma, it is not easy, while dwelling in the home, to live the spiritual life absolutely fulfilled, absolutely pure, like a polished shell. Well now, after shaving off head-hair and beard, and donning ochre clothes, I could go forth from the home to homelessness.’ Reverend Sir, may Master Mahākaccāyana give me the going forth.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When that was said, venerable Mahākaccāyana said this to the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa: “A solitary meal, a solitary bed, and celibacy, Soṇa, for as long as life lasts, is difficult, come on, Soṇa, right now while still living as a householder, you should devote yourself to the Buddhas’ teaching, and at suitable times i.e. On Observance days have only a solitary meal, a solitary bed, and celibacy.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then whatever determination the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa had to go forth abated. For a second time when the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: “According to the way Master Mahākaccāyana teaches the Dhamma, it is not easy, while dwelling in the home, to live the spiritual life, absolutely fulfilled, absolutely pure, like a polished shell.

<p class="bodytext">For a third time when the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: “In the way Master Mahākaccāyana teaches the Dhamma, it is not easy, while dwelling in the home, to live the spiritual life, absolutely fulfilled, absolutely pure, like a polished shell.

<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Mahākaccāyana gave the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa the going forth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then at that time there were few monks in the Southern State of Avanti. Then with the passing of three years venerable Mahākaccāyana, having assembled, with difficulty and with trouble, from here and there, a group of ten monks from the Community of monks, gave venerable Soṇa full ordination.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then when venerable Soṇa, after residing for the Rains Retreat, had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: “I have not seen the Gracious One face to face, but I have heard that the Gracious One is such and such a one. If my preceptor would allow it I could go to see the Gracious One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the venerable Soṇa, having risen from seclusion in the evening time, went to venerable Mahākaccāyana, and after going and worshipping venerable Mahākaccāyana, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Soṇa said this to venerable Mahākaccāyana:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Here, reverend Sir, having gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in my mind: ‘I have not seen the Gracious One face to face, but I have heard that the Gracious One is such and such a one.’ If my preceptor would allow it I could go to see the Gracious One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Soṇa, you must go, Soṇa, to see the Gracious One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha. You will see, Soṇa, that Gracious One who is confident, inspiring confidence, with sense faculties at peace, mind at peace, having attained supreme self-control and calm, controlled, guarded, with restrained faculties, a true nāga. Having seen him, in my name you should worship the Gracious One’s feet with your head, ask if he is free from affliction, free from sickness, in good health, strong, and living comfortably, saying:</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘My Preceptor, venerable Mahākaccāyana, reverend Sir, worships the Gracious One’s feet with his head, and asks if you are free from affliction, free from sickness, in good health, strong, and living comfortably?’ ”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir”, said venerable Soṇa, and after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of venerable Mahākaccāyana, having worshipped and circumambulated venerable Mahākaccāyana, after putting his dwelling place in order, and picking up his robe and bowl, he went on walking tour towards Sāvatthī. Walking gradually on walking tour he went to Sāvatthī, Jeta’s Wood, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, and the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Soṇa said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“My Preceptor, venerable Mahākaccāyana, reverend Sir, worships the Gracious One’s feet with his head, and asks if you are free from affliction, free from sickness, in good health, strong, and living comfortably?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Can you bear up, monk? Can you carry on? Did you come along the road without fatigue, and without going short of alms?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I can bear up, Gracious One, I can carry on, Gracious One, and I did come along the road without fatigue, and without going short of alms.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One addressed Venerable Ānanda, saying: “Please prepare a dwelling place, Ānanda, for this visiting monk.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to venerable Ānanda: “When the Gracious One orders me, saying: ‘Please prepare a dwelling place, Ānanda, for this visiting monk,’ the Gracious One wants to dwell together with that monk in one living quarters. The Gracious One wants to dwell together with venerable Soṇa in one living quarters.” And in the living quarters where the Gracious One was living, there he prepared a dwelling place for venerable Soṇa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One having spent most of the night sitting in the open air, after washing his feet, entered the living quarters. Also venerable Soṇa having spent most of the night sitting in the open air, after washing his feet, entered the living quarters.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then towards the time of dawn, after rising, the Gracious One requested venerable Soṇa, saying: “May you be inspired to speak about the Dhamma, monk.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir,” said venerable Soṇa, and after replying to the Gracious One, he melodiously recited all sixteen discourses of the Chapter of the Eights.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then at the end of venerable Soṇa’s melodious recitation the Gracious One greatly rejoiced, saying: “Good, good, monk, well learned, monk, well remembered, well born in mind, are the sixteen discourses of the Chapter of the Eights, you are endowed with a good voice, with good enunciation, pure articulation, which makes the meaning clear. How many Rains do you have, monk?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I have one Rains, Gracious One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But why, monk, did it take you so long to ordain?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For a long time, reverend Sir, I have seen the danger in sensual desires, but dwelling in the home there was obstruction, with many duties and many things to do.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<h2 class="title">The Discourse about Those with Knotted Hair</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at the Eastern Monastery in Migāra’s mother’s mansion. Then at that time the Gracious One having risen from seclusion in the evening time, was sitting outside the doorway.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. Then at that time seven knotted-haired ascetics, seven of those knot-free i.e. Jainas, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloakers, and seven wanderers, with their nails, armpit-hair, and body hair grown long, having taken up their various requisites, were passing by not far away from the Gracious One.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Kosalan King Pasenadi saw those seven knotted-haired ascetics, seven of those knot-free, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloakers, and seven wanderers, with their nails, armpit-hair, and body hair grown long, who, having taken up their various requisites, were passing by not far away from the Gracious One. Having seen them, after rising from his seat, arranging his outer robe on one shoulder, placing his right knee-cap on the ground, towards the place where those seven knotted-haired ascetics, seven of those knot-free, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloakers, and seven wanderers were, raising his hands in respectful salutation, he three times announced his name, saying: “Reverend Sirs, I am the Kosalan King Pasenadi.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi, not long after those seven knotted-haired ascetics, seven of those knot-free, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloakers, and seven wanderers had gone, went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side, While sat on one side the Kosalan King Pasenadi said this to the Gracious One: “Among those in the world, reverend Sir, who are Worthy Ones, or have entered the path to Worthiness, these are some of them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But this is hard to know, Great King, by you, a householder, partaking of sense pleasures, by one dwelling in a sleeping place crowded with sons, by one enjoying sandalwood from Kāsi, by one wearing garlands, scents, and creams, by one delighting in gold and silver: ‘These are Worthy Ones, or these have entered the path to Worthiness,’</p>

<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

<p class="bodytext">There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: “The world is eternal—this alone is the truth, all else is foolish.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: “The world is not eternal—this alone is the truth, all else is foolish.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">They lived contending, quarelling, disputing, attacking each other with sharp tongues, saying: “Such is Dhamma, such is not Dhamma; such is not Dhamma, such is Dhamma.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then many monks, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up their bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. After walking for alms in Sāvatthī, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, they went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Here, reverend Sir, many and various sectarians, ascetics, brāhmaṇas, and wanderers are living at Sāvatthī, having various views, various likings, various tendencies, subject to dependence on various views, such as:</p>

<p class="bodytext">They live contending, quarelling, disputing, attacking each other with sharp tongues, saying: ‘Such is Dhamma, such is not Dhamma; such is not Dhamma, such is Dhamma.’ ”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Wanderers from other sects, monks, are blind, without vision, they do not know what is good, they do not know what is not good, they do not know what is Dhamma, they do not know what is not Dhamma.

<p class="bodytext">“Formerly, monks, in this Sāvatthī there was a certain King. Then that King, monks, addressed a certain man, saying: ‘Please go, dear Sir, and as many of those congenitally blind as there are in Sāvatthī assemble them in one place.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Yes, your Majesty’, said that man, monks, and after replying to the King, and after taking hold of all of those congenitally blind in Sāvatthī, he went to the King, and after going he said this to the King: ‘As many of those congenitally blind as there are in Sāvatthī, your Majesty, have assembled.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Then show an elephant, I say, to those congenitally blind.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Yes, your Majesty’, said that man, monks, and after replying to the King, he showed an elephant to those congenitally blind, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant’s head, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant’s ear, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant’s tusk, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant’s trunk, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant’s body, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant’s leg, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant’s thigh, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To some of those congenitally blind he showed the top of the elephant’s tail, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“To some of those congenitally blind he showed the tip of the elephant’s tail, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then, monks, that man, having shown the elephant to those congenitally blind, went to the King, and after going he said this to the King: ‘Those congenitally blind have seen the elephant, your Majesty, now is the time for whatever you are thinking, your Majesty.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then that King, monks, went to the congenitally blind, and after going he said this to those congenitally blind: ‘Did you see the elephant, blind men?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Yes, your Majesty, we did see the elephant.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“‘Speak, blind men, and say: “Such is an elephant.” ’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant’s head, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a pot.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant’s ear, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a winnowing fan. ’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant’s tusk, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a ploughshare.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant’s trunk, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a plough-pole.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant’s body, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a store-house’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant’s leg, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a pillar.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant’s thighs, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a mortar.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those congenitally blind who had seen the top of the elephant’s tail, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a pestle.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those congenitally blind who had seen the tip of the elephant’s tail, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a broom.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And they, saying: ‘Such is an elephant, such is not an elephant; such is not an elephant, such is an elephant,’ hit each other with their fists, and with that, monks, the King was pleased.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Just so, monks, wanderers from other sects are blind, without vision, they do not know what is good, they do not know what is not good, they do not know what is Dhamma, they do not know what is not Dhamma.

<h2 class="title">The Discourse about the Well</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was walking on walking tour amongst the Mallas with a great Community of monks and arrived at the brāhmaṇa village of the Mallas called Thūna. The brāhmaṇa householders of Thūna heard: “The ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is walking on walking tour amongst the Mallas with a great Community of monks and has arrived at Thūna”, and they completely filled the well to the top with grass and chaff, thinking: “May these shaveling ascetics not drink our drinking water.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having gone down from the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat. While sat the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: “Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water from that well.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “Now the well, reverend Sir, has been filled to the top with grass and chaff by the brāhmaṇa householders of Thūna, thinking: ‘May these shaveling ascetics not drink our drinking water.’ ”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: “Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water from that well.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “Now the well, reverend Sir, has been filled to the top with grass and chaff by the brāhmaṇa householders of Thūna, thinking: ‘May these shaveling ascetics not drink our drinking water.’ ”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: “Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water from that well.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir”, said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, and taking the bowl, he went to the well. Then as venerable Ānanda was going to that well, all the grass and chaff was thrown away from the top of the well, and it stood full of transparent, undisturbed, clear water, to the top so that one might think it was overflowing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to venerable Ānanda: “Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, the Realised One’s great power and great majesty, in that as I was going to that well, all the grass and chaff was thrown away from the top of the well, and it stood full of transparent, undisturbed, clear water, to the top so that one might think it was overflowing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After taking drinking water with a bowl he went to the Gracious One, and after going, he said this to the Gracious One: “It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, the Realised One’s great power and great majesty, in that as I was going to that well, all the grass and chaff was thrown away from the top of the well, and it stood full of transparent, undisturbed, clear water, to the top so that one might think it was overflowing. Please drink the drinking water, Gracious One! Please drink the drinking water, Fortunate One!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What will he do with a well, if there will be water at all times?</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Having cut off craving at the root, who will go about seeking?”</p>

<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then at that time when King Udena had gone to the pleasure park, the inner quarters of the palace were burnt down, and five hundred women died with Queen Sāmāvatī at their head.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then many monks, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up their bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms, and after walking for alms in Kosambī, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Here, reverend Sir, when King Udena had gone to the pleasure park, the inner quarters of the palace were burnt down, and five hundred women died with Queen Sāmāvatī at their head. What is the destination of the female lay followers, reverend Sir, what is their future state?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There are in this, monks, female lay followers who are stream-enterers, there are once-returners, there are non-returners,—none of those female lay followers died, monks, without having attained some result.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was walking on walking tour amongst the Mallas with a great Community of monks, and arrived at Pāva. There the Gracious One dwelt near Pāva, in Cunda the smith’s mango wood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Cunda the smith heard: “The Gracious One, it seems, is walking on walking tour amongst the Mallas with a great Community of monks, and has arrived at Pāva, and is dwelling near Pāva, in my mango wood.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Cunda the smith went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While Cunda the smith sat on one side the Gracious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered him with a Dhamma talk.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Cunda the smith, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a Dhamma talk, said to the Gracious One: “May the Gracious One consent, reverend Sir, to me offering him a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.” The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence. Then Cunda the smith, having understood the Gracious One’s consent, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then with the passing of that night, Cunda the smith, in his own residence, having had excellent comestibles and edibles made ready, and an abundance of tender pork, had the time accounced to the Gracious One, saying: “It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, went to Cunda the smith’s residence, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat. Having sat down the Gracious One addressed Cunda the smith, saying: “Serve me with the tender pork you have prepared, Cunda, but serve the Community of monks with the other comestibles and edibles which have been prepared.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir”, said Cunda the smith, and after replying to the Gracious One, he served the Gracious One with the tender pork that had been prepared, but served the Community of monks with the other comestibles and edibles which had been prepared.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One addressed Cunda the smith, saying: “Throw that left over tender pork into a pit, Cunda, for I do not see, Cunda, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas, princes and men, one who, having eaten it, could completely digest it, except for a Realised One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir”, said Cunda the smith, and after replying to the Gracious One, and throwing what was left over of that tender pork into a pit, he went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side the Gracious One, after instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering Cunda the smith with a Dhamma talk, having risen from the seat, went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then for the Gracious One, after eating Cunda the smith’s food, a painful affliction arose, dysentery, and strong feelings occurred, such as end in death. There the Gracious One, mindfully, with full awareness, bore those pains without being troubled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: “Come, Ānanda, let us go to Kusināra.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir”, venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Having eaten Cunda the smith’s food, so I have heard,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">The Firm One experienced a very strong affliction, such as ends in death.</p end="">
<p class="gatha">For the Teacher, who had eaten tender pork,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">A very strong sickness arose.</p end="">

<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir”, said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, he prepared the outer robe folded in four, and the Gracious One sat down on the prepared seat.</p>
<p class="bodytext">While sat the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: “Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water, I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “Just now, reverend Sir, five hundred wagons have passed by, and the little water that flows, having been churned by the wheels, is stirred up and disturbed. The Kukutthā river is not far away, with transparent water, agreeable water, cool water, pure water, with beautiful banks, a delightful place, there the Gracious One can drink drinking water, and can cool his limbs.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: “Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water, I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “Just now, reverend Sir, five hundred wagons have passed by, and the little water that flows, having been churned by the wheels, is stirred up and disturbed.

<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir”, said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, and taking the bowl, he went to the river. Then that little river that was flowing, which had been churned by the wheels, and was stirred up and disturbed, as venerable Ānanda was going, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to venerable Ānanda: “Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, the Realised One’s great power and great majesty, in that that little river that is flowing, which has been churned by wheels, and is stirred up and disturbed, as I was going, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One with a great Community of monks went to the river Kukutthā, and after going, and entering into the river Kukutthā, bathing, and drinking, and coming back out, went to the mango wood, and after going, he addressed venerable Cundaka, saying: “Come now, Cundaka, prepare the outer robe folded in four for me, I am weary, Cundaka, and will lie down.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend Sir”, said venerable Cundaka, and after replying to the Gracious One, he prepared the outer robe folded in four. Then the Gracious One lay down on his right side in the lion’s posture, after placing one foot on the top of the other, mindfully, with full awareness, having applied his mind to the thought of rising. And venerable Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Gracious One.</p>

<p class="gatha">And in the middle of the group of monks, at the front,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">The Teacher, the Gracious One, having taught the Dhamma here,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">The Great Sage went to the mango wood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He addressed the monk called Cundaka, saying:</p end="">

<p class="gatha">Very quickly spread the robe folded in four.</p end="">
<p class="gatha">The Teacher, very weary, lay down,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">With Cunda sat right there at the front.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: “It may be, Ānanda, that someone might cause remorse for the smith Cunda, saying: ‘There is no gain for you, friend Cunda, it is a poor gain for you, friend Cunda, in that the Realised One, after eating his last almsfood from you, attained Complete Emancipation.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If there is remorse for Cunda the smith, Ānanda, drive it out in this way, saying: ‘There is a gain for you, friend Cunda, it is a good gain for you, friend Cunda, in that the Realised One, after eating his last almsfood from you, attained Complete Emancipation. I heard this face to face with the Gracious One, friend Cunda, I learned it face to face:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There are these two almsfoods which have the same fruit, have the same result, that is a greater fruit, a greater result than other almsfood. Which two?</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That almsfood which, after eating, the Realised One awakens to the unsurpassed Perfect Awakening; and that almsfood which, after eating, the Realised One attains Complete Emancipation in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining. These are the two almsfoods which have the same excellent fruit, have the same excellent result, that is a greater fruit, a greater result than other almsfood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Friend Cunda the smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to long life, friend Cunda the smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to beauty, friend Cunda the smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to happiness, friend Cunda the smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to fame, friend Cunda the smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to heaven, friend Cunda the smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to sovereignty.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If there is remorse for Cunda the smith, Ānanda, you should drive it out in this way!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="gatha">From restraint hatred is not accumulated.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The skilful one gives up what is bad,</p end="">

<p class="bodytext">“For as long, Ānanda, as there is an Ariyan sphere of influence, for as long as there is trade, this basket-opening Pāṭaliputta will be the chief city. For Pāṭaliputta, Ānanda, there will be three dangers: from fire and from water and from the breaking of an alliance.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra went to the Gracious One, and after going, they exchanged greetings with the Gracious One and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, they stood on one side. While stood on one side the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra said this to the Gracious One: “May Gotama consent, dear Sir, to us offering him a meal today, together with the Community of monks.” The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra having understood the Gracious One’s consent, went to their own dwelling, and after going, in their own dwellings having had excellent comestibles and edibles made ready, announced the time to the Gracious One, saying: “It is time, dear Gotama, the meal is ready.” Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, went to the dwelling of the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra with their own hands served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head with excellent comestibles and edibles. Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra, when the Gracious One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, having taken a low seat, sat down on one side. While sat on one side the Gracious One rejoiced the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra with these verses:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In that place where he makes his dwelling, having entertained</p end="">
<p class="gatha">The wise and virtuous here, the restrained, who live the spiritual life,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">He should dedicate a gift to the devatās who are in that place.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Honoured, they pay honour, revered, they revere him.</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Thereafter they have compassion on him, as a mother on her own son,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">A man whom the devatās have compassion on</p end="">
<p class="gatha">always sees what is auspicious.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One after rejoicing the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra with these verses, and rising from his seat, went away.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra were following close behind the Gracious One, thinking: “That gate by which the ascetic Gotama leaves will get the name the Gotama Gate, and that ford by which he crosses the river Gaṅgā will get the name the Gotama Ford.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then that gate by which the Gracious One left got the name the Gotama Gate, then the Gracious One went to the river Gaṅgā. Then at that time the river Gaṅgā was full to the brim, and could be drunk from by crows perched on the bank. Some of the people were seeking boats, some were seeking floats, and some were binding rafts, desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, so did he vanish from the near bank of the river Gaṅgā, and reappeared on the far bank, together with the Community of monks. The Gracious One saw those people, some seeking boats, some seeking floats, and some binding rafts, desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Those who cross over a sea or a lake, </p end="">
<p class="gatha">Do so after making a bridge, and leaving the pond behind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“While people are still binding together a raft,</p end="">
<p class="gatha">Intelligent people have crossed over.”</p>

<h2 class="title">The Discourse on the Two Paths</h2>
<p class="bodytext">thus i heard: At one time the Gracious One was going along the high road amongst the Kosalans with venerable Nāgasamāla as the attendent ascetic who followed behind him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The venerable Nāgasamāla saw two paths on the road, and having seen that, he said this to the Gracious One: “This is the path, reverend Sir, let us go by this one, Gracious One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, the Gracious One said this to venerable Nāgasamāla: “This is the path, Nāgasamāla, let us go by this one.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time venerable Nāgasamāla said this to the Gracious One: “This is the path, reverend Sir, let us go by this one, Gracious One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, the Gracious One said this to venerable Nāgasamāla: “This is the path, Nāgasamāla, let us go by this one.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time venerable Nāgasamāla said this to the Gracious One: “This is the path, reverend Sir, let us go by this one, Gracious One.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After that was said, the Gracious One said this to venerable Nāgasamāla: “This is the path, Nāgasamāla, let us go by this one.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then venerable Nāgasamāla, having put the Gracious One’s bowl and robe on the floor right there and then, went away, saying: “This is the Gracious One’s bowl and robe, reverend Sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then as venerable Nāgasamāla was going along by that path, thieves who had gone along the road, attacked him with their hands and feet, broke his bowl, and tore his double-robe. Then venerable Nāgasamāla, with his broken bowl and torn double-robe went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">While sat on one side venerable Nāgasamāla said this to the Gracious One: “Here, reverend Sir, as I was going along by that path thieves who had gone along the path, attacked me with their hands and feet, broke my bowl, and tore my double-robe.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then Migāra’s mother Visākhā, with wet clothes and hair, in the middle of the day went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, she sat down on one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">While sat on one side the Gracious One said this to Migāra’s mother Visākhā: “Now where have you come from, Visākhā, with wet clothes and hair, and why are you coming here in the middle of the day?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“My grand-daughter, who was beloved and dear, reverend Sir, has died. That is why, with wet clothes and hair, I am coming here in the middle of the day.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Would you like, Visākhā, as many children and grand-children as there are people in Sāvatthī?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I would like, Gracious One, as many children and grand-children as there are people in Sāvatthī.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But how many people, Visākhā, die every day in Sāvatthī?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ten people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, nine people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, eight people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, seven people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, six people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, five people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, four people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, three people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, two people, reverend Sir, die every day in Sāvatthī, one person, reverend Sir, dies every day in Sāvatthī, Sāvatthī is never secluded from people who are dying.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Now what do you think, Visākhā, would you ever be without wet clothes and hair?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Surely not, reverend Sir, I have had enough, reverend Sir, with so many children and grand-children!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For those who have a hundred loves, Visākhā, they have a hundred sufferings, for those who have ninety loves, they have ninety sufferings, for those who have eighty loves, they have eighty sufferings, for those who have seventy loves, they have seventy sufferings, for those who have sixty loves, they have sixty sufferings, for those who have fifty loves, they have fifty sufferings, for those who have forty loves, they have forty sufferings, for those who have thirty loves, they have thirty sufferings, for those who have twenty loves, they have twenty sufferings, for those who have ten loves, they have ten sufferings, for those who have nine loves, they have nine sufferings, for those who have eight loves, they have eight sufferings, for those who have seven loves, they have seven sufferings, for those who have six loves, they have six sufferings, for those who have five loves, they have five sufferings, for those who have four loves, they have four sufferings, for those who have three loves, they have three sufferings, for those who have two loves, they have two sufferings, for those who have one love, they have one suffering, for those who love nothing, they have no sorrow.
