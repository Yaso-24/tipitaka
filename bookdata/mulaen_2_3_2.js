<h3 class="subhead">1. Dependent Origination</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I will teach you dependent origination. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what is dependent origination? Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. This is called dependent origination.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I will teach and analyze for you dependent origination. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what is dependent origination? Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is old age and death? The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called old age. The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called death. Such is old age, and such is death. This is called old age and death.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is rebirth? The rebirth, inception, conception, reincarnation, manifestation of the aggregates, and acquisition of the sense fields of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called rebirth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is continued existence? There are these three states of existence. Existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm. This is called continued existence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is grasping? There are these four kinds of grasping. Grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self. This is called grasping.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is craving? There are these six classes of craving. Craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. This is called craving.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is feeling? There are these six classes of feeling. Feeling born of contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. This is called feeling.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is contact? There are these six classes of contact. Contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. This is called contact.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the six sense fields? The sense fields of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. These are called the six sense fields.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are name and form? Feeling, perception, intention, contact, and attention. This is called name. The four primary elements, and form derived from the four primary elements. This is called form. Such is name and such is form. These are called name and form.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is consciousness? There are these six classes of consciousness. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness. This is called consciousness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are choices? There are three kinds of choices. Choices by way of body, speech, and mind. These are called choices.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is ignorance? Not knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. This is called ignorance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so, ignorance is a condition for choices.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I will teach you the wrong practice and the right practice. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what’s the wrong practice? Ignorance is a condition for choices.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. This is called the wrong practice.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what’s the right practice? When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is called the right practice.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">4. About Vipassī</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, Vipassī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha had this thought before his awakening, when he was still unawakened but intent on awakening: ‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, thought: ‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what exists is there rebirth? What is a condition for rebirth?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When continued existence exists there’s rebirth. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what exists is there continued existence? What is a condition for continued existence?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When grasping exists there’s continued existence. Grasping is a condition for continued existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what exists is there grasping? What is a condition for grasping?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When craving exists there’s grasping. Craving is a condition for grasping.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what exists is there feeling? What is a condition for feeling?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When contact exists there’s feeling. Contact is a condition for feeling.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what exists is there contact? What is a condition for contact?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When the six sense fields exist there’s contact. The six sense fields are a condition for contact.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what exists are there the six sense fields? What is a condition for the six sense fields?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When name and form exist there are the six sense fields. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what exists are there name and form? What is a condition for name and form?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. ‘Origination, origination.’ While Vipassī was intent on awakening, such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in him regarding teachings not learned before from another.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no old age and death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth doesn’t exist there’s no old age and death. When rebirth ceases, old age and death cease.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no rebirth? When what ceases does rebirth cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When continued existence doesn’t exist there’s no rebirth. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no continued existence? When what ceases does continued existence cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When grasping doesn’t exist there’s no continued existence. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no contact? When what ceases does contact cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When the six sense fields don’t exist there’s no contact. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what doesn’t exist are there no six sense fields? When what ceases do the six sense fields cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When name and form don’t exist there are no six sense fields. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what doesn’t exist are there no name and form? When what ceases do name and form cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When consciousness doesn’t exist there are no name and form. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no consciousness? When what ceases does consciousness cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When choices don’t exist there’s no consciousness. When choices cease, consciousness ceases.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Vipassī thought: ‘When what doesn’t exist are there no choices? When what ceases do choices cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom: ‘When ignorance doesn’t exist there are no choices. When ignorance ceases, choices cease.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so, when ignorance ceases, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. ‘Cessation, cessation.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, regarding teachings not learned before from another.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot said to the Buddha, “But sir, who consumes the fuel for consciousness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s not a fitting question,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t speak of one who consumes. If I were to speak of one who consumes, then it would be fitting to ask who consumes. But I don’t speak like that. Hence it would be fitting to ask: ‘Consciousness is a fuel for what?’ And a fitting answer to this would be: ‘Consciousness is a fuel that conditions rebirth into a new state of existence in the future. When that which has been reborn is present, there are the six sense fields. The six sense fields are a condition for contact.’”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">17. With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. The naked ascetic Kassapa saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. He went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and said to the Buddha,</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’d like to ask Master Gotama about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Kassapa, it’s the wrong time for questions. We’ve entered an inhabited area.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">A second time, and a third time, Kassapa spoke to the Buddha and the Buddha replied. When this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha,</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t want to ask much.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Ask what you wish, Kassapa.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, Master Gotama, is suffering made by oneself?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then is suffering made by another?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, is suffering made by both oneself and another?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then does suffering arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, is there no such thing as suffering?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s not that there’s no such thing as suffering. Suffering is real.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then Master Gotama doesn’t know nor see suffering.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s not that I don’t know or see suffering. I do know suffering, I do see suffering.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, when asked these questions, you say ‘not so’. Yet you say that there is such a thing as suffering. And you say that you do know suffering, and you do see suffering. Sir, explain suffering to me! Teach me about suffering!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suppose that the person who does the deed experiences the result. Then for one who has existed since the beginning, suffering is made by oneself. This statement leans toward eternalism. Suppose that one person does the deed and another experiences the result. Then for one stricken by feeling, suffering is made by another. This statement leans toward annihilationism. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Kassapa, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. However, I have recognized individual differences.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then the wanderer Timbaruka went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, Master Gotama, are pleasure and pain made by oneself?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then are pleasure and pain made by another?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, are pleasure and pain made by both oneself and another?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“It’s not that I don’t know or see pleasure and pain. I do know pleasure and pain, I do see pleasure and pain.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Master Gotama, when asked these questions, you say ‘not so’. Yet you say that there is such a thing as pleasure and pain. And you say that you do know pleasure and pain, and you do see pleasure and pain. Sir, explain pleasure and pain to me! Teach me about pleasure and pain!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suppose that the feeling and the one who feels it are the same thing. Then for one who has existed since the beginning, pleasure and pain is made by oneself. I don’t say this. Suppose that the feeling is one thing and the one who feels it is another. Then for one stricken by feeling, pleasure and pain is made by another. I don’t say this. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, the wanderer Timbaruka said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! … I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For a fool hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced. But the fool has not given up that ignorance or finished that craving. Why is that? The fool has not completed the spiritual journey for the complete ending of suffering. Therefore, when their body breaks up, the fool is reborn in another body. When reborn in another body, they’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re not freed from suffering, I say.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I will teach you dependent origination and dependently originated phenomena. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And what is dependent origination? Rebirth is a condition for old age and death. Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles, specific conditionality. A Realized One understands this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it. ‘Look,’ he says, ‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Continued existence is a condition for rebirth … Grasping is a condition for continued existence … Craving is a condition for grasping …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Feeling is a condition for craving … Contact is a condition for feeling … The six sense fields are a condition for contact … Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Consciousness is a condition for name and form …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Choices are a condition for consciousness … Ignorance is a condition for choices. Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles, specific conditionality. A Realized One understands this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it. ‘Look,’ he says, ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.’ So the fact that this is real, not unreal, not otherwise; the specific conditionality of it: this is called dependent origination.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what are the dependently originated phenomena? Old age and death are impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. Rebirth … Continued existence … Grasping … Craving …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Feeling … Contact … The six sense fields … Name and form …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Consciousness …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Choices … Ignorance is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. These are called the dependently originated phenomena.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When a noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are, it’s impossible for them to turn back to the past, thinking: ‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past?’ Or to turn forward to the future, thinking: ‘Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’ Or to be undecided about the present, thinking: ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’ Why is that? Because that noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, a Realized One has ten powers and four kinds of self-assurance. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.

<p class="bodytext">So the teaching has been well explained by me, made clear, opened, illuminated, and stripped of patchwork. Just this much is quite enough for someone who has gone forth out of faith from a good family to rouse up their energy. ‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and tendons remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by manly strength, energy, and vigor.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">A lazy person lives in suffering, mixed up with bad, unskillful qualities, and ruins a great deal of their own good. An energetic person lives happily, secluded from bad, unskillful qualities, and fulfills a great deal of their own good.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The best isn’t reached by the worst. The best is reached by the best. This spiritual life is the cream, mendicants, and the Teacher is before you.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized, thinking: ‘In this way our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile. And our use of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them.’ That’s how you should train.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Considering your own good, mendicants, is quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering the good of others is quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering the good of both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see. For one who knows and sees what? ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I say that this knowledge of ending has a vital condition, it doesn’t lack a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Freedom.’ I say that freedom has a vital condition, it doesn’t lack a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Dispassion.’ I say that dispassion has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Disillusionment.’ I say that disillusionment has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Truly knowing and seeing.’ I say that truly knowing and seeing has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Immersion.’ I say that immersion has a vital condition.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is it? You should say: ‘Bliss.’ I say that bliss has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Tranquility.’ I say that tranquility has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Rapture.’ I say that rapture has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Joy.’ I say that joy has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Faith.’ I say that faith has a vital condition.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is it? You should say: ‘Suffering.’ I say that suffering has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Rebirth.’ I say that rebirth has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Continued existence.’ I say that continued existence has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Grasping.’ I say that grasping has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Craving.’ I say that craving has a vital condition.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is it? You should say: ‘Feeling.’ … You should say: ‘Contact.’ … You should say: ‘The six sense fields.’ … You should say: ‘Name and form.’ … You should say: ‘Consciousness.’ … You should say: ‘Choices.’ … I say that choices have a vital condition, they don’t lack a vital condition. And what is the vital condition for choices? You should say: ‘Ignorance.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">So ignorance is a vital condition for choices. Choices are a vital condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a vital condition for name and form. Name and form are vital conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are vital conditions for contact. Contact is a vital condition for feeling. Feeling is a vital condition for craving. Craving is a vital condition for grasping. Grasping is a vital condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a vital condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a vital condition for suffering. Suffering is a vital condition for faith. Faith is a vital condition for joy. Joy is a vital condition for rapture. Rapture is a vital condition for tranquility. Tranquility is a vital condition for bliss. Bliss is a vital condition for immersion. Immersion is a vital condition for truly knowing and seeing. Truly knowing and seeing is a vital condition for disillusionment. Disillusionment is a vital condition for dispassion. Dispassion is a vital condition for freedom. Freedom is a vital condition for the knowledge of ending.</p>

Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha. Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Sāriputta, there are ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. Some of them declare that suffering is made by oneself. Some of them declare that suffering is made by another. Some of them declare that suffering is made by both oneself and another.

<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Ānanda! It’s just as Sāriputta has so rightly explained. I have said that pleasure and pain are dependently originated. Dependent on what? Dependent on contact. Saying this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by oneself, that’s conditioned by contact. … In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or another, that’s also conditioned by contact.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Ānanda, as long as there’s a body, the intention that gives rise to bodily action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there’s a voice, the intention that gives rise to verbal action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there’s a mind, the intention that gives rise to mental action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. But these only apply when conditioned by ignorance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">By oneself one instigates the choice that gives rise to bodily, verbal, and mental action, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself. Or else others instigate the choice … One consciously instigates the choice … Or else one unconsciously instigates the choice …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ignorance is included in all these things.

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta, “Sāriputta, this was said in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Ajita’:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘Those who have comprehended the teaching,</p>
<p class="gatha">and the many kinds of trainees here—</p>

<p class="bodytext">How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Sāriputta kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a second time …</p>
<p class="bodytext">For a third time …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sāriputta kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sāriputta, do you see that this has come to be?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, one truly sees with right wisdom that this has come to be. Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be. One truly sees with right wisdom that it originated with that as fuel. Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding the fuel for its origination. One truly sees with right wisdom that when that fuel ceases, what has come to be is liable to cease. Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what is liable to cease. In this way one is a trainee.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what, sir, is one who has comprehended the teaching? Sir, one truly sees with right wisdom that this has come to be. Seeing this, one is freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be. One truly sees with right wisdom that it originated with that as fuel. Seeing this, one is freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding the fuel for its origination. One truly sees with right wisdom that when that fuel ceases, what has come to be is liable to cease. Seeing this, one is freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what is liable to cease. In this way one has comprehended the teaching.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the mendicant Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot has rejected the training and returned to a lesser life.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That venerable mustn’t have got any satisfaction in this teaching and training.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, has Venerable Sāriputta found satisfaction in this teaching and training?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, I have no uncertainty.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But what of the future?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I have no doubt.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has declared enlightenment: ‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the Buddha said to a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell Sāriputta that the teacher summons him.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” replied Sāriputta. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Sāriputta, is it really true that you have declared enlightenment: ‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I did not state the meaning in these words and phrases.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sāriputta, no matter how a gentleman declares enlightenment, what they have declared should be regarded as such.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, did I not also say that I did not state the meaning in these words and phrases?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But Reverend Sāriputta, how have you known and seen so that you’ve declared enlightenment: “I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’ How would you answer?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I would answer: ‘Reverends, because of the ending of the source of rebirth, when it ended, I knew “it is ended”. Knowing this, I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But what is the source, origin, birthplace, and root of rebirth?’ How would you answer?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I would answer: ‘Continued existence is the source, origin, birthplace, and root of rebirth.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘What is the source of continued existence?’ How would you answer?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Grasping is the source of continued existence.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘What is the source of grasping?’ … But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘What is the source of craving?’ How would you answer?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Feeling is the source of craving.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But how have you known and seen so that the relishing of feelings is no longer present?’ How would you answer?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Reverends, there are three feelings. What three? Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. These three feelings are impermanent, and what’s impermanent is suffering. When I understood this, the relishing of feelings was no longer present.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Sāriputta! The same point may also be briefly explained in this way: ‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But Reverend, how have you been released that you declare enlightenment: “I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”?’ How would you answer?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Because of an inner release with the ending of all grasping, I live mindfully so that defilements don’t defile me and I don’t look down on myself.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Sāriputta! The same point may also be briefly explained in this way: ‘I have no uncertainty regarding the defilements spoken of by the ascetic. I have no doubt that I’ve given them up.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants, “Reverends, the first question that the Buddha asked me was something that I’d not previously considered, so I hesitated. But when the Buddha agreed with my answer, I thought: ‘If the Buddha were to question me all day on this matter in different words and ways, I could answer all day with different words and ways. If he were to question me all night, all day and night, for two days and nights, for three, four, five, six, or seven days and nights, I could answer in different words and ways for seven days and nights.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has roared his lion’s roar!” (And he told the Buddha all that Sāriputta had said.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicant, Sāriputta has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings, so that he could answer any questions I might ask him in different words and ways up to the seventh day and night.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">41. Dangers and Threats</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Anyone who steals creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from stealing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Anyone who commits sexual misconduct creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from committing sexual misconduct.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Anyone who lies creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from lying.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom? A noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; when this doesn’t exist, that is not. Due to the arising of this, that arises; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. Ignorance is a condition for choices.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’ This is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">51. A Full Inquiry</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, how do you define a mendicant who is making a full inquiry for the complete ending of suffering?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, take a mendicant who makes a full inquiry: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. What is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? When what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’ While making a full inquiry they understand: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. The source of this suffering is rebirth. When rebirth exists, old age and death come to be. When rebirth doesn’t exist, old age and death don’t come to be.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then they inquire further: ‘But what is the source of this rebirth? When what exists does rebirth come to be? And when what does not exist does rebirth not come to be?’ While making a full inquiry they understand: ‘Continued existence is the source of rebirth. When continued existence exists, rebirth comes to be. When continued existence does not exist, rebirth doesn’t come to be.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand rebirth, its origin, its cessation, and the fitting practice for its cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of rebirth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then they inquire further: ‘But what is the source of this continued existence? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this grasping? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this craving? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this feeling? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this contact? …’ … ‘But what is the source of these six sense fields? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this name and form? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this consciousness? …’ … ‘But what is the source of these choices? When what exists do choices come to be? When what does not exist do choices not come to be?’ While making a full inquiry they understand: ‘Ignorance is the source of choices. When ignorance exists, choices come to be. When ignorance does not exist, choices don’t come to be.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand choices, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of choices.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If an ignorant individual makes a good choice, their consciousness enters a good realm. If they make a bad choice, their consciousness enters a bad realm. If they make an imperturbable choice, their consciousness enters an imperturbable realm. When a mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, they don’t make a good choice, a bad choice, or an imperturbable choice. Not choosing or intending, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a person were to remove a hot clay pot from a potter’s kiln and place it down on level ground. Its heat would dissipate right there, and the shards would be left behind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Would a mendicant who has ended the defilements still make good choices, bad choices, or imperturbable choices?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there are no choices at all, with the cessation of choices, would consciousness still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there’s no consciousness at all, would name and form still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there are no name and form at all, would the six sense fields still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there are no six sense fields at all, would contact still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there’s no contact at all, would feeling still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there’s no feeling at all, would craving still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there’s no craving at all, would grasping still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there’s no grasping at all, would continued existence still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there’s no continued existence at all, would rebirth still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And when there’s no rebirth at all, would old age and death still be found?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, mendicants! That’s how it is, not otherwise. Trust me on this, mendicants; be convinced. Have no doubts or uncertainties in this matter. Just this is the end of suffering.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. Why is that? This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and laid to rest. That’s why, when it comes to this body, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But when it comes to that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed. Why is that? Because for a long time they’ve been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and mistaken it: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ That’s why, when it comes to this mind, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self, rather than the mind. Why is that? This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night. It’s like a monkey moving through the forest.

In the same way, that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.

<p class="bodytext">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. Why is that? This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and laid to rest. That’s why, when it comes to this body, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. But when it comes to that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed. Why is that? Because for a long time they’ve been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and mistaken it: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ That’s why, when it comes to this mind, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self, rather than the mind. Why is that? This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer. But that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops. Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops. Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops.

Painful feeling … Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral.

<h3 class="subhead">63. A Child’s Flesh</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born. What four? Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how should you regard solid food? Suppose a couple who were husband and wife set out to cross a desert, taking limited supplies. They had an only child, dear and beloved. As the couple were crossing the desert their limited quantity of supplies would run out, and they’d still have the rest of the desert to cross. Then it would occur to that couple: ‘Our limited quantity of supplies has run out, and we still have the rest of the desert to cross. Why don’t we kill our only child, so dear and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat? Then we can make it across the desert by eating our child’s flesh. Let not all three perish.’ Then that couple would kill their only child, so dear and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat. They’d make it across the desert by eating their child’s flesh. And as they’d eat their child’s flesh, they’d beat their breasts and cry: ‘Where are you, our only child? Where are you, our only child?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Would they eat that food for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Wouldn’t they eat that food just so they could make it across the desert?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I say that this is how you should regard solid food. When solid food is completely understood, desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood. When desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood, a noble disciple is bound by no fetter that might return them again to this world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how should you regard contact as fuel? Suppose there was a flayed cow. If she stands by a wall, the creatures on the wall bite her. If she stands under a tree, the creatures in the tree bite her. If she stands in some water, the creatures in the water bite her. If she stands in the open, the creatures in the open bite her. Wherever that flayed cow stands, the creatures there would bite her. I say that this is how you should regard contact as fuel. When contact as fuel is completely understood, the three feelings are completely understood. When the three feelings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how should you regard mental intention as fuel? Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked. Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. Then two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals. Then that person’s intention, aim, and wish would be to get far away. Why is that? Because that person would think: ‘If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that will result in my death or deadly pain.’ I say that this is how you should regard mental intention as fuel. When mental intention as fuel is completely understood, the three cravings are completely understood. When the three cravings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how should you regard consciousness as fuel? Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: ‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears!’ The king’s men did as they were told. Then at midday the king would say: ‘My men, how is that man?’ ‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the middle of the day with a hundred spears!’ The king’s men did as they were told. Then late in the afternoon the king would say: ‘My men, how is that man?’ ‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears!’ The king’s men did as they were told.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears a day?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, let alone three hundred spears!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I say that this is how you should regard consciousness as fuel. When consciousness as fuel is completely understood, name and form is completely understood. When name and form are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">65. The City</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there rebirth? … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … What is a condition for name and form?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ Then it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there consciousness? What is a condition for consciousness?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When name and form exist there’s consciousness. Name and form are a condition for consciousness.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me: This consciousness turns back from name and form, and doesn’t go beyond that. This is the extent to which one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is: name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. ‘Origination, origination.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no old age and death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth doesn’t exist there is no old age and death. When rebirth ceases old age and death cease.’ Then it occurred to me: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no rebirth … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … six sense fields … name and form? When what ceases do name and form cease?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When consciousness doesn’t exist name and form don’t come to be. When consciousness ceases name and form cease.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no consciousness? When what ceases does consciousness cease?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When name and form don’t exist, there is no consciousness. When name and form cease, consciousness ceases.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to me: I have discovered the path to awakening. That is: When name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. ‘Cessation, cessation.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a person was walking through a forest. They’d see an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past. Following it along, they’d see an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments. Then that person would inform a king or their minister: ‘Please sir, you should know this. While walking through a forest I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past. Following it along I saw an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments. Sir, you should rebuild that city!’ Then that king or their minister would have that city rebuilt. And after some time that city was successful and prosperous and full of people, attained to growth and expansion. In the same way, I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And what is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Following it along, I directly knew old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. Following it along, I directly knew rebirth … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … consciousness … Following it along, I directly knew choices, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Having directly known this, I told the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. And that’s how this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, do you perform inner self-examination?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, “Sir, I perform inner self-examination.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But mendicant, how do you perform inner self-examination?” Then that mendicant answered, but the Buddha was not happy with the answer.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha speak of the inner self-examination. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Take a mendicant who performs inner self-examination: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. But what is the source of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? And when what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’ While examining they know: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. The source of this suffering is attachment. When attachments exist old age and death come to be. And when attachments do not exist old age and death don’t come to be.’ They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They perform further inner self-examination: ‘But what is the source of this attachment? When what exists does attachment come to be? And when what does not exist does attachment not come to be?’ While examining they know: ‘The source of this attachment is craving. When craving exists attachments come to be. And when craving doesn’t exist attachments don’t come to be.’ They understand attachments, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of attachments.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They perform further inner self-examination: ‘But where does that craving arise and where does it settle?’ While examining they know: ‘That craving arises and settles on whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant. And what in the world seems nice and pleasant? The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. The ear … nose … tongue … body … mind in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">There were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe. Their craving grew. As their craving grew, their attachments grew. As their attachments grew, their suffering grew. And as their suffering grew, they were not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They were not freed from suffering, I say.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is consciousness made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Just now I understood you to say: ‘No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">But I also understood you to say: ‘No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">How then should we see the meaning of this statement?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, reverend, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose there were two bundles of reeds leaning up against each other.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. If the first of those bundles of reeds were to be pulled away, the other would collapse. And if the other were to be pulled away, the first would collapse.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, when name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s incredible, Reverend Sāriputta, it’s amazing! How well spoken this was by Venerable Sāriputta! And we can express our agreement with Venerable Sāriputta’s statement on these thirty-six grounds.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who speaks on Dhamma’. If they practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who practices in line with the teaching’. If they’re freed by not grasping by disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who has attained extinguishment in this very life’. If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment regarding rebirth … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … consciousness … choices … If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding ignorance, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who speaks on Dhamma’. If they practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding ignorance, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who practices in line with the teaching’. If they’re freed by not grasping by disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding ignorance, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who has attained extinguishment in this very life’.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">68. At Kosambī</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At one time the venerables Musīla, Saviṭṭha, Nārada, and Ānanda were staying near Kosambī in Ghosita’s monastery. Then Venerable Saviṭṭha said to Venerable Musila:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Musila, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that rebirth is a condition for old age and death.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Musila, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that continued existence is a condition for rebirth … grasping is a condition for continued existence … craving is a condition for grasping … feeling is a condition for craving … contact is a condition for feeling … the six sense fields are conditions for contact … name and form are conditions for the six sense fields … consciousness is a condition for name and form … choices are a condition for consciousness … ignorance is a condition for choices?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that ignorance is a condition for choices.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Musila, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that when rebirth ceases, old age and death cease?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that when rebirth ceases, old age and death cease.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Musila, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that when continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases … when grasping ceases, continued existence ceases … when craving ceases, grasping ceases … when feeling ceases, craving ceases … when contact ceases, feeling ceases … when the six sense fields cease, contact ceases … when name and form cease, the six sense fields cease … when consciousness ceases name and form cease … when choices cease consciousness ceases … when ignorance ceases, choices cease?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that when ignorance ceases, choices cease.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Musila, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then Venerable Musila is a perfected one, with defilements ended.” When he said this, Musila kept silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Nārada said to Venerable Saviṭṭha, “Reverend Saviṭṭha, please let me answer these questions. Ask me and I will answer them for you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“By all means, Venerable Nārada, try these questions. I’ll ask you and you can answer them for me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">(Saviṭṭha repeats exactly the same series of questions, and Nārada answers just as Musila did.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Nārada, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Then Venerable Nārada is a perfected one, with defilements ended.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I have truly seen clearly with right wisdom that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment. Yet I am not a perfected one. Suppose there was a well on a desert road that had neither rope nor bucket. Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. They’d know that there was water, but they couldn’t physically touch it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, I have truly seen clearly with right wisdom that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment. Yet I am not a perfected one.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Saviṭṭha, “Reverend Saviṭṭha, what do you have to say to Venerable Nārada when he speaks like this?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Ānanda, I have nothing to say to Venerable Nārada when he speaks like this, except what is good and wholesome.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">70. The Wanderer Susīma</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And the mendicant Saṅgha was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they received robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But the wanderers who followed other paths were not honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated. And they didn’t receive robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time the wanderer Susīma was residing at Rājagaha together with a large community of wanderers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then his community said to Susīma, “Reverend Susīma, please live the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama. Memorize that teaching and have us recite it with you. When we’ve memorized it we’ll recite it to the laity. In this way we too will be honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated. And we’ll receive robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverends,” replied Susīma. Then he went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda, “Reverend Ānanda, I wish to live the spiritual life in this teaching and training.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Ānanda took Susīma to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, this wanderer Susīma says that he wishes to live the spiritual life in this teaching and training.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, Ānanda, give Susīma the going forth.” And the wanderer Susīma received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence: “We understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Venerable Susīma heard about this. He went up to those mendicants, and exchanged greetings with them. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to those mendicants, “Is it really true that the venerables have declared enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic power? That is, multiplying yourselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. Do you control the body as far as the Brahmā realm?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind? Do you understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’? Do you understand mind with hate as ‘mind with hate’, and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate’? Do you understand mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion’, and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion’? Do you understand constricted mind as ‘constricted mind’, and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind’? Do you understand expansive mind as ‘expansive mind’, and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind’? Do you understand mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme’, and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme’? Do you understand mind immersed in samādhi as ‘mind immersed in samādhi’, and mind not immersed in samādhi as ‘mind not immersed in samādhi’? Do you understand freed mind as ‘freed mind’, and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding? Do you remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Do you recollect your many kinds of past lives, with features and details?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds? ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, do you see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And do you understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, reverend.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well now, venerables, how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Susīma, we are freed by wisdom.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Susīma, whether you understand or not, we are freed by wisdom.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Susīma went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with those mendicants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Susīma, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Susīma, whether you understand or not, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Susīma? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is feeling permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is perception permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.” …</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Are choices permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Suffering, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So, Susīma, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of feeling at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* feeling—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of perception at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* perception—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of choices at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all choices*—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Susīma, do you see that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you see that continued existence is a condition for rebirth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you see that grasping is a condition for continued existence?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you see that craving is a condition for grasping?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you see that feeling is a condition for craving … contact is a condition for feeling … the six sense fields are conditions for contact … name and form are conditions for the six sense fields … consciousness is a condition for name and form … choices are a condition for consciousness … ignorance is a condition for choices?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you see that when rebirth ceases old age and death cease?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you see that when continued existence ceases rebirth ceases?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do you see that when grasping ceases continued existence ceases … when craving ceases, grasping ceases … when feeling ceases, craving ceases … when contact ceases, feeling ceases … when the six sense fields cease, contact ceases … when name and form cease, the six sense fields cease … when consciousness ceases name and form cease … when choices cease consciousness ceases … when ignorance ceases choices cease?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic power? …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind? …”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn … according to their deeds?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well now, Susīma, how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Susīma bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said, “I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Indeed, Susīma, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training. Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: ‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ The king’s men would do as they were told. What do you think, Susīma? Wouldn’t that man experience pain and distress because of that?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Although that man would experience pain and distress because of that, going forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training has a more painful and bitter result. And it even leads to the underworld. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the noble one to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha, picking up a little bit of dirt under his fingernail, addressed the mendicants: “What do you think, mendicants? Which is more: the little bit of dirt under my fingernail, or this great earth?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, the great earth is far more. The little bit of dirt under your fingernail is tiny. Compared to the great earth, it’s not nearly a hundredth, a thousandth, or a hundred thousandth part.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“In the same way, for a noble disciple accomplished in view, a person with comprehension, the suffering that’s over and done with is more, what’s left is tiny. Compared to the mass of suffering in the past that’s over and done with, it’s not nearly a hundredth, a thousandth, or a hundred thousandth part, since there are at most seven more lives.

The element of light, the element of beauty, the element of the dimension of infinite space, the element of the dimension of infinite consciousness, the element of the dimension of nothingness, the element of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, and the element of the cessation of perception and feeling. These are the seven elements.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts arise for a reason, not without reason.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how do sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts arise for a reason, not without reason? The element of sensuality gives rise to sensual perceptions. Sensual perceptions give rise to sensual thoughts. Sensual thoughts give rise to sensual desires. Sensual desires give rise to sensual passions. Sensual passions give rise to searches for sensual pleasures. An uneducated ordinary person on a search for sensual pleasures behaves badly in three ways: by body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The element of malice gives rise to malicious perceptions. Malicious perceptions give rise to malicious thoughts. … malicious desires … malicious passions … malicious searches … An uneducated ordinary person on a malicious search behaves badly in three ways: by body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The element of cruelty gives rise to cruel perceptions. Cruel perceptions give rise to cruel thoughts. … cruel desires … cruel passions … cruel searches … An uneducated ordinary person on a cruel search behaves badly in three ways: by body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a person was to drop a burning torch in a thicket of dry grass. If they don’t quickly extinguish it with their hands and feet, the creatures living in the grass and wood would come to ruin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, a corrupt perception might arise in an ascetic or brahmin. If they don’t quickly give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it, they’ll suffer in the present life, with anguish, distress, and fever. And when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect to be reborn in a bad place.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness arise for a reason, not without reason.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And how do thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness arise for a reason, not without reason? The element of renunciation gives rise to perceptions of renunciation. Perceptions of renunciation give rise to thoughts of renunciation. Thoughts of renunciation give rise to enthusiasm for renunciation. Enthusiasm for renunciation gives rise to fervor for renunciation. Fervor for renunciation gives rise to the search for renunciation.

<p class="bodytext">In the same way, a corrupt perception might arise in an ascetic or brahmin. If they quickly give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it, they’ll be happy in the present life, free of anguish, distress, and fever.

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, an element gives rise to a perception, a view, and a thought.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">When he said this, Venerable Kaccāna said to the Buddha, “Sir, regarding those who are not fully awakened Buddhas, there is a view that they are in fact fully awakened Buddhas. Due to what does this view appear?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s a mighty thing, Kaccāna, the element of ignorance. An inferior element gives rise to inferior perceptions, inferior views, inferior thoughts, inferior intentions, inferior aims, inferior wishes, an inferior person, and inferior speech. One explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals the inferior. I say that their rebirth is inferior.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A middling element gives rise to middling perceptions, middling views, middling thoughts, middling intentions, middling aims, middling wishes, a middling person, and middling speech. One explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals the middling. I say that their rebirth is middling.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A superior element gives rise to superior perceptions, superior views, superior thoughts, superior intentions, superior aims, superior wishes, a superior person, and superior speech. One explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals the superior. I say that their rebirth is superior.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. Suppose a person was to strip all the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in India, gather them together into one pile, and chop them each into four inch pieces. They’d lay them down, saying: ‘This is my mother, this is my grandmother.’ The grass, sticks, branches, and leaves of India would run out before that person’s mothers and grandmothers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a long time you have undergone suffering, agony, and disaster, swelling the cemeteries.

<p class="bodytext">Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove. Then thirty mendicants from Pāvā went to the Buddha. All of them lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; yet they all still had fetters. They bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then it occurred to the Buddha, “These thirty mendicants from Pāvā live in the wilderness, eat only alms-food, wear rag robes, and own just three robes; yet they all still have fetters. Why don’t I teach them the Dhamma in such a way that their minds are freed from defilements by not grasping while sitting in this very seat?”</p>

The flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is indeed more than the water in the four oceans. For a long time you’ve been cows, and the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off as a cow is more than the water in the four oceans.

It took them four days to climb Mount Vepulla, and four days to descend. At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva. See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions, so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Vaṅkaka. And at that time people were known as Rohitassas. The lifespan of the Rohitassas was 30,000 years. It took them three days to climb Mount Vepulla, and three days to descend. At that time Koṇāgamana, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Koṇāgamana had a fine pair of chief disciples named Bhiyyosa and Uttara. See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Supassa. And at that time people were known as Suppiyas. The lifespan of the Suppiyas was 20,000 years. It took them two days to climb Mount Vepulla, and two days to descend. At that time Kassapa, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Kassapa had a fine pair of chief disciples named Tissa and Bhāradvāja. See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions …</p>
<p class="bodytext">These days this Mount Vepulla is known as Vepulla. And these people are known as Magadhans. The lifespan of the Magadhans is short, brief, and fleeting. A long life is a hundred years or a little more. It takes the Magadhans an hour to climb Mount Vepulla, and an hour to descend. And now I am the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha who has arisen in the world. I have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna. There will come a time when this mountain’s name will disappear, those people will die, and I will be fully extinguished.

<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, you should approach families like the moon: withdrawn in body and mind, always the newcomer, and never impudent. Suppose a person were to look down at an old well, a rugged cliff, or an inaccessible riverland. They’d withdraw their body and mind. In the same way, you should approach families like the moon: withdrawn in body and mind, always the newcomer, and never impudent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Kassapa approaches families like the moon: withdrawn in body and mind, always the newcomer, and never impudent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, mendicants? What kind of mendicant is worthy of approaching families?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha waved his hand in space.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, this hand is not stuck or held or caught in space. In the same way, when approaching families, a mendicant’s mind is not stuck or held or caught, thinking: ‘May those who want material possessions get them, and may those who want merit make merits!’ They’re just as pleased and happy when others get something as they are when they get something. This kind of mendicant is worthy of approaching families.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When Kassapa approaches families, his mind is not stuck or held or caught, thinking: ‘May those who want material possessions get them, and may those who want merit make merits!’ He’s just as pleased and happy when others get something as he is when he gets something.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Whoever teaches Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they gain confidence in the teaching and demonstrate their confidence to me.’ Such a mendicant’s teaching is impure.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whoever teaches Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they understand the teaching and practice accordingly.’ So they teach others because of the natural excellence of the teaching, out of compassion, kindness, and sympathy. Such a mendicant’s teaching is pure.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Whoever visits families with the thought: ‘May they give to me, may they not fail to give. May they give a lot, not a little. May they give me fine things, not coarse. May they give quickly, not slowly. May they give carefully, not carelessly.’ If a mendicant with such a thought approaches a family and they don’t give, the mendicant feels slighted. And they experience pain and sadness because of that. If they give only a little … if they give coarse things … if they give slowly … if they give carelessly, the mendicant feels slighted.

<p class="bodytext">“You’re old now, Kassapa. Those worn-out hempen rag robes must be a burden for you. So Kassapa, you should wear clothes given by householders, accept invitations for the meal, and stay in my presence.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For a long time, sir, I’ve lived in the wilderness, eaten only alms-food, worn rag robes, and owned just three robes; and I’ve praised these things. I’ve been one of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and I’ve praised these things.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But seeing what benefit, Kassapa, have you long practiced these things?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, seeing two benefits I have long practiced these things.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I see a happy life for myself in the present. And I have compassion for future generations, thinking: ‘Hopefully those who come after might follow my example.’ For they may think: ‘It seems that the awakened disciples of the Buddha for a long time lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; and they praised these things. They were of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praised these things.’ They’ll practice accordingly, which will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">6. Advice</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove. Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Kassapa, advise the mendicants! Give them a Dhamma talk! Either you or I should advise the mendicants and give them a Dhamma talk.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, the mendicants these days are hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Take the monk called Bhaṇḍa, Ānanda’s pupil. He’s been competing in studies with the monk called Abhiñjika, Anuruddha’s pupil. They say: ‘Come on, monk, who can recite more? Who can recite better? Who can recite longer?’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the Buddha said to a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell the monk called Bhaṇḍa, Ānanda’s pupil, and the monk called Abhiñjika, Anuruddha’s pupil that the teacher summons them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those monks and said, “Venerables, the teacher summons you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied. They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is it really true, monks, that you’ve been competing in studies, saying: ‘Come on, monk, who can recite more? Who can recite better? Who can recite longer?’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this: ‘Please mendicants, compete in studies to see who can recite more and better and longer’?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“If you’ve never known me to teach the Dhamma like this, then what exactly do you know and see, you foolish men, that after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training you’d compete in studies to see who can recite more and better and longer?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then those monks bowed with their heads at the Buddha’s feet and said, “We have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of us in that after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training we competed in studies to see who can recite more and better and longer. Please, sir, accept our mistake for what it is, so we will restrain ourselves in future.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Indeed, monks, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the noble one to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">9. Absorptions and Insights</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, I enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, I enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, I enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. I control the body as far as the Brahmā realm. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. I understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’; mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … mind immersed in samādhi … mind not immersed in samādhi … freed mind … unfreed mind … And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, I recollect my many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives, with features and details. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. And so does Kassapa.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements. And so does Kassapa.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

<p class="bodytext">“You go, Reverend Ānanda. You have many duties and responsibilities.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And a second time …</p>
<p class="bodytext">And a third time, Ānanda said, “Kassapa, come, sir. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Mahākassapa robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to one of the nuns’ quarters, where he sat on the seat spread out. And then several nuns went up to Mahākassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahākassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But the nun Thullatissā was upset and blurted out, “What is Master Mahākassapa thinking, that he’d teach Dhamma in front of Master Ānanda, the Videhan sage? He’s like a needle seller who thinks they can sell a needle to a needle maker!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mahākassapa heard Thullatissā say these words, and he said to Ānanda, “Is that right, Reverend Ānanda? Am I the needle seller and you the needle maker? Or am I the needle maker and you the needle seller?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Forgive her, sir. The woman’s a fool.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Hold on, Reverend Ānanda! Don’t make the Saṅgha investigate you further!</p>
<p class="bodytext">What do you think, Reverend Ānanda? Was it you who the Buddha brought up before the Saṅgha of mendicants, saying: ‘Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.

<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And at that time thirty of Ānanda’s mendicant pupils rejected the training and returned to a lesser life. Most of them were youths.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When Venerable Ānanda had wandered in the Southern Hills as long as he wished, he set out for Rājagaha, to the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. He went up to Venerable Mahākassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahākassapa said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Ānanda, for how many reasons did the Buddha lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three among families?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, the Buddha laid down that rule for three reasons. For keeping difficult persons in check and for the comfort of good-hearted mendicants. To prevent those of wicked desires from taking sides and dividing the Saṅgha. And out of consideration for families. These are the three reasons why the Buddha laid down that rule.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with these junior mendicants? They don’t guard their sense doors, they eat too much, and they’re not committed to wakefulness. It’s like you’re wandering about wrecking crops and ruining families! Your following is falling apart, Reverend Ānanda, and those just getting started are slipping away. Yet this boy knows no bounds!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Though there are grey hairs on my head, I still can’t escape being called a boy by Venerable Mahākassapa.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s because you wander with these junior mendicants. … Your following is falling apart, Reverend Ānanda, and those just getting started are slipping away. Yet this boy knows no bounds!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The nun Thullanandā heard a rumor that Master Mahākassapa had rebuked Master Ānanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She was upset and blurted out, “How can Master Mahākassapa, who formerly followed another path, presume to rebuke Master Ānanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mahākassapa heard Thullanandā say these words, and he said to Ānanda, “Indeed, Reverend Ānanda, the nun Thullanandā spoke rashly and without reflection.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, I don’t recall acknowledging any other teacher apart from the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Formerly when I was still a layman, I thought: ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ After some time I made an outer robe of patches and, in the name of the perfected ones in the world, I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When I had gone forth, I traveled along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda, where I saw the Buddha sitting at the Bahuputta Shrine. Seeing him, I thought: ‘If I’m ever to see a Teacher, it would be this Blessed One! If I’m ever to see a Holy One, it would be this Blessed One! If I’m ever to see a fully awakened Buddha, it would be this Blessed One!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then I bowed with my head at the Buddha’s feet and said: ‘Sir, the Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple! The Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple!’</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha said to me, ‘Kassapa, if anyone was to say to such a wholehearted disciple that they know when they don’t know, or that they see when they don’t see, their head would explode. But Kassapa, when I say that I know and see I really do know and see.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So you should train like this: “I will set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for seniors, juniors, and those in the middle.” That’s how you should train.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And you should train like this: “Whenever I hear a teaching connected with what’s skillful, I will pay heed, pay attention, engage wholeheartedly, and lend an ear to that teaching.” That’s how you should train.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And you should train like this: “I will never neglect mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure.” That’s how you should train.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">And when the Buddha had given me this advice he got up from his seat and left. For seven days I ate the nation’s almsfood as a debtor. On the eighth day I was enlightened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a tree. So I spread out my outer robe of patches folded in four and said to him, ‘Sir, sit here. That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha sat on the seat spread out and said to me, ‘Kassapa, this outer robe of patches is soft.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘Sir, please accept my outer robe of patches out of compassion.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘In that case, Kassapa, will you wear my worn-out hempen rag robe?’</p>
<p class="bodytext">‘I will wear it, sir.’</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so I presented my outer robe of patches to the Buddha, and the Buddha presented me with his worn-out hempen rag robe.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For if anyone should be rightly called the Buddha’s true-born child, born from his mouth, born of the teaching, created by the teaching, heir to the teaching, and receiver of his worn-out hempen rag robes, it’s me.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. …</p>

<p class="bodytext">I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time Venerable Mahākassapa and Venerable Sāriputta were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahākassapa, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākassapa:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend Kassapa, does a Realized One exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, this has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, does a Realized One not exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well then, does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And why has this not been declared by the Buddha?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Because it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why it has not been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So what now has been declared by the Buddha?” “‘This is suffering’ has been declared by the Buddha. ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’ has been declared by the Buddha.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And why has this been declared by the Buddha?”</p>

<h3 class="subhead">13. The Counterfeit of the True Teaching</h3>
<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more enlightened mendicants? And what is the cause, what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s how it is, Kassapa. When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants. The true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world. But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s like true gold, which doesn’t disappear as long as counterfeit gold hasn’t appeared in the world. But when counterfeit gold appears in the world then real gold disappears.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, the true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world. But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s not the elements of earth, water, fire, or air that make the true teaching disappear. Rather, it’s the foolish people who appear right here that make the true teaching disappear. The true teaching doesn’t disappear like a ship that sinks all at once.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are five detrimental things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. What five? It’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion. These five detrimental things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are five things that lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. What five? It’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen maintain respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion. These five things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.”</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Possessions, honor, and popularity came to Devadatta for his own ruin and downfall.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It’s like a banana tree … or a bamboo … or a reed, all of which bear fruit to their own ruin and downfall …</p>

That there can be such a sentient being, such an entity, such an incarnation!’”</p>

<p class="bodytext">And then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a great lake in the jungle, with bull elephants living nearby. They’d plunge into the lake and pull up lotus bulbs with their trunks. They’d wash them thoroughly until they were free of mud before chewing and swallowing them. That was good for their appearance and health, and wouldn’t result in death or deadly pain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The young cubs, following the example of the great bull elephants, plunged into the lake and pulled up lotus bulbs with their trunks. But they didn’t wash them thoroughly, and while they were still muddy they chewed and swallowed them. That was not good for their appearance and health, and resulted in death or deadly pain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, there are senior mendicants who robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms. There they speak on the teachings, and lay people demonstrate their confidence in them. And when they get things, they use them untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape.

The cat caught it and hastily swallowed it without chewing. But that little mouse ate its intestines and mesentery, resulting in death and deadly pain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the same way, take a certain monk who robes up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters the village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties. There he sees a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes. Lust infects his mind, resulting in death or deadly pain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For it is death in the training of the noble one to reject the training and return to a lesser life. And it is deadly pain to commit one of the corrupt offenses for which rehabilitation is possible.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, next to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna I’m like a few pieces of gravel next to the Himalayas, the king of mountains. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is so mighty and powerful he could, if he wished, live on for the eon.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reverend, next to Venerable Sāriputta I’m like a few grains of salt next to a mound of salt. Venerable Sāriputta has been commended, complimented, and praised by the Buddha:</p>
<p class="gatha0">‘In wisdom,</p>
<p class="gatha">ethics, and peace,</p>
<p class="gatha">any mendicant who has crossed over</p>
<p class="gatha">can at best equal Sāriputta.’”</p>
<p class="bodytext">And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others’ fine words.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">4. A Junior Mendicant</h3>
<p class="bodytext">At Sāvatthī.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time a certain junior monk, after his meal, on his return from alms-round, entered his dwelling, where he adhered to passivity and silence. And he didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes. Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the Buddha said to a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell that monk that the Teacher summons him.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to that monk and said to him, “Reverend, the teacher summons you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” that monk replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is it really true, monk, that after your meal, on your return from alms-round, you entered your dwelling, where you adhered to passivity and silence, and you didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, I am doing my own work.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, don’t complain about this monk. This monk gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. He has realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life, and lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Not by being slack,</p>
<p class="gatha">or with little strength</p>
<p class="gatha">is extinguishment realized,</p>
<p class="gatha">the freedom from all suffering.</p>
<p class="gatha0">This young monk,</p>
<p class="gatha">this best of men,</p>
<p class="gatha">carries his final body,</p>
<p class="gatha">having vanquished Māra and his mount.”</p>

He’s attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. And he has realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“This mendicant is truly beautiful.</p>
<p class="gatha">His heart is upright,</p>
<p class="gatha">he’s unfettered, detached,</p>
<p class="gatha">extinguished by not grasping.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Lakuṇṭaka Bhaddiya went to see the Buddha.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance, and addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, do you you see this monk coming—ugly, unsightly, deformed, and despised by the mendicants?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That mendicant is very mighty and powerful. It’s not easy to find an attainment that he has not already attained. And he has realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>

<p class="gatha">elephants and spotted deer—</p>
<p class="gatha">though their bodies are not equal,</p>
<p class="gatha">they all fear the lion.</p>

<p class="bodytext">so i have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli’s son, was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, who was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, it was Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli’s son.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the Buddha said to Visākha:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good, good, Visākha! It’s good that you educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, with words that are polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“Though an astute person is mixed up with fools,</p>
<p class="gatha">they don’t know unless he speaks.</p>
<p class="gatha">But when he speaks they know,</p>
<p class="gatha">he’s teaching the deathless state.</p>
<p class="gatha0">He should speak and illustrate the teaching,</p>

<p class="bodytext">Then Venerable Nanda—the Buddha’s cousin on his mother’s side—dressed in nicely pressed and ironed robes, applied eyeshadow, and took a polished black bowl. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Nanda, as a gentleman who has gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, it’s not appropriate for you to dress in nicely pressed and ironed robes, apply eyeshadow, and carry a polished black bowl. It’s appropriate for you to stay in the wilderness, eat only alms-food, wear rag robes, and live without concern for sensual pleasures.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“When will I see Nanda</p>
<p class="gatha">in the wilderness, wearing rag robes,</p>
<p class="gatha">feeding on scraps offered by strangers,</p>
<p class="gatha">unconcerned for sensual pleasures?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then some time later Venerable Nanda stayed in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, wore rag robes, and lived without concern for sensual pleasures.</p>

<p class="bodytext">“Tissa, why are you sitting there so miserable and sad, with tears flowing?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sir, it’s because the mendicants on all sides provoke me with barbed words.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s because you admonish others, but don’t accept admonition yourself. As a gentleman who has gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, it’s not appropriate for you to admonish others without accepting admonition yourself. It’s appropriate for you to admonish others and accept admonition yourself.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>

<p class="bodytext">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now at that time there was a certain mendicant named Senior. He lived alone and praised living alone. He entered the village for alms alone, returned alone, sat in private alone, and concentrated on walking meditation alone.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, there’s a certain mendicant named Senior who lives alone and praises living alone.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the Buddha said to a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Senior that the teacher summons him.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Venerable Senior and said to him, “Reverend Senior, the teacher summons you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, reverend,” that monk replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Is it really true, Senior, that you live alone and praise living alone?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But in what way do you live alone and praise living alone?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Well, sir, I enter the village for alms alone, return alone, sit in private alone, and concentrate on walking meditation alone. That’s how I live alone and praise living alone.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That is a kind of living alone, I don’t deny it. But as to how living alone is fulfilled in detail, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, sir,” he replied.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And how, Senior, is living alone fulfilled in detail? It’s when what’s in the past is given up, what’s in the future is relinquished, and desire and greed for present incarnations is eliminated. That’s how living alone is fulfilled in detail.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:</p>
<p class="gatha0">“The sage, champion, knower of all,</p>
<p class="gatha">is unsullied in the midst of all things.</p>
<p class="gatha">He’s given up all, freed in the ending of craving:</p>
